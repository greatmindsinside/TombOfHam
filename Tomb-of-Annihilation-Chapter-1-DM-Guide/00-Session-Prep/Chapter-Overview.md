## Purpose of Chapter 1

Chapter 1 of Tomb of Annihilation serves as "Welcome to Chult: City Hub Tutorial." The chapter focuses on Port Nyanzaru, the only major civilized city in Chult and the starting hub for the entire campaign. It's designed to land the party in a loud, colorful, dinosaur-filled city where they can gear up, meet key NPCs, and choose their first real direction into the jungle.

## Chapter Structure

The book uses Chapter 1 for four main purposes:

### 1. Arrival and First Impressions

- Characters arrive in Port Nyanzaru via Syndra's teleport
- Experience: bustling tropical port city, dinosaurs as labor/racers, brightly painted buildings, crowded markets, noisy docks
- Feels thriving, civilized, and very different from typical "grimy Sword Coast towns"

### 2. City as Quest and Rumor Hub

- Port Nyanzaru serves as a quest board and social sandbox
- Multiple side quests: collecting debts, saving innocents, escorting priests, hunting pirates, exploring nearby regions
- Rumor tables and NPCs provide information about Chult, the Death Curse, and jungle locations

### 3. Factions and Power Structure

- **Merchant Princes**: Control trade and resources, each specializing in different areas (magic, weapons, beasts, guides)
- **Off-world factions**: Harpers, Flaming Fist, Order of the Gauntlet, Emerald Enclave, Lords' Alliance, Zhentarim
- Provides opportunities for bargaining, political favors, and future patrons/enemies

### 4. Preparing the Expedition

- **Supplies**: Food, water, insect repellent, canoes, tents (emphasis on disease, heat, logistics)
- **Guides**: List of guides with personalities, secret agendas, and knowledge of jungle locations (choice heavily influences Act 2)
- **Charter**: Optional exploration charter from Flaming Fist to avoid being treated as looters

### 5. Fun Intro Set Pieces

- Dinosaur racing rules and betting (emphasizes colorful, weird tone)
- Sample street encounters: dinosaur stampedes, small combats (eases players into jungle dangers)
