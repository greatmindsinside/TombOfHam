## Practical DM Takeaway

Chapter 1 functions as a **Job Board + Tutorial City** where players:

- Learn about the Death Curse in-world
- Meet factions and potential patrons
- Gather rumors and side quests
- Hire guides and gear up

**Transition**: Move to Chapter 2 when players stride out into the jungle with a destination in mind *(Chapter 2: **p. 37**)*.

## Prep Tips

- Prepare arrival scene and 2-3 vivid locations in Port Nyanzaru
- Decide which side quests and guides to include
- Choose first jungle destination and seed appropriate rumors

## Alternative Chapter Structures

### Fast-Track Version

- Quick landing zone: one arrival scene, one social scene, one street encounter
- Pick guide, buy gear, enter jungle by session's end

### City-Campaign Mini Arc

- Extend over multiple sessions for politics-focused players
- Emphasize Merchant Prince rivalries, criminal underworld, dinosaur racing leagues, faction missions

### Tutorial Mode

- Teach new players core mechanics:
  - Skill checks and social interaction
  - Light combat/chases in streets
  - Travel prep and resource management
