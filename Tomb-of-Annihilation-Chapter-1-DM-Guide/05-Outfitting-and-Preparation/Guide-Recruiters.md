## DM Guidance

Guide recruiters serve as an introduction to the guide selection process. They can be found in various locations (taverns, markets, docks) and actively approach newcomers. Use recruiters to present 2-3 guide options initially, making the selection process more accessible. Recruiters may have their own agendas (commissions, specific guide preferences) but should provide useful information. This is a natural way to introduce the guide selection process without requiring players to seek out Merchant Prince Kwayothe's office. Guide choice heavily influences Act 2 destinations and encounters.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe recruiters and guides for signs of reliability

- **Success**: "You notice details about the recruiters and the guides they're promoting: the quality of their equipment, their bearing, how they present themselves. Some appear more professional and reliable than others. You can identify which guides seem trustworthy and which might be risky choices."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters and guides all seem capable, but you can't determine which ones are most reliable or experienced."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you can identify specific signs of experience (old scars, well-maintained equipment, confident bearing), detect signs of trouble (nervousness, poor equipment, suspicious behavior), and even notice subtle details that reveal each guide's true capabilities and potential problems. You can make an informed decision about which guide to consider."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research recruiter and guide reputations

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you can learn about the recruiters and the guides they're promoting: their past expeditions, their success rate, and what previous clients have said about them. You can identify which guides are reliable and which have problematic histories."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters' and guides' backgrounds are difficult to verify, and you can't determine their true reputations."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you learn about each recruiter's connections and motivations, each guide's complete history, their success and failure rates, their methods, and even rumors about their secrets or hidden agendas. You can identify which recruiters are honest brokers versus those pushing specific guides for their own reasons. You might even discover specific information about guide destinations or methods that helps you make a better choice."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read recruiters' true motivations and detect deception

- **Success**: "You can sense the recruiters' true motivations. Some are genuinely trying to help you find the right guide, while others may be pushing specific guides for commissions or other reasons. You can identify which recruiters are trustworthy and which you should approach with caution."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters seem helpful, but you can't determine their true motivations or if they're being completely honest."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific motivations (genuine helpfulness, commission-seeking, hidden agendas), identify when recruiters are exaggerating guide capabilities, sense which guides recruiters genuinely recommend versus those they're pushing for personal gain, and even predict how different recruiters will react to your questions. You can identify the best way to interact with each recruiter to get honest information."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Get recruiters to share honest information or better deals

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest help build rapport. The recruiters become more open, sharing additional information about guides, their methods, and potential concerns. They may even offer to arrange better terms or introduce you to guides not initially presented."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters remain polite but stick to their prepared pitches, sharing only basic information."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your approach is so effective that recruiters become genuinely helpful. They share valuable information about guide strengths and weaknesses, warn you about potential problems, offer to arrange interviews with multiple guides, and may even provide discounts or additional services. Some recruiters might introduce you to guides they normally wouldn't recommend, giving you more options."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information about guide recruiters or their organizations

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about guide recruitment in Port Nyanzaru. Some recruiters work independently, while others are associated with Merchant Prince Kwayothe's organization or the guide guild. Their reputations vary, and some are known to be more reliable than others."
- **Failure**: "You don't recall specific information about guide recruiters or their organizations."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you recall detailed information about the guide recruitment system in Port Nyanzaru, which recruiters are associated with which organizations, their reputations for honesty, and even rumors about specific recruiters' methods or connections. You know which recruiters are trustworthy brokers versus those who might have hidden agendas."

## What Recruiters Say (Key Dialogue)

### Initial Approach

"'New to Port Nyanzaru, are you? Planning an expedition into the jungle? You'll need a guide - that's not optional, it's essential. The jungle kills the unprepared, and even experienced adventurers can get lost or worse without proper guidance. I represent several excellent guides, each with their own specialties. Let me introduce you to some options...'"

### About the Importance of Guides

"'The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Even the most experienced adventurers can get lost, fall to disease, or fall prey to the countless dangers that lurk in the undergrowth. A good guide doesn't just know the way - they know how to avoid danger, find water, treat disease, and navigate terrain that would kill the unprepared. Without a guide, your chances of survival drop dramatically.'"

### About Guide Selection

"'Each guide has their own methods, their own knowledge, and their own specialties. Some know the rivers, some know the ruins, some know the tribes. Choose based on where you want to go and what you want to accomplish. But remember - this is one of the most important decisions you'll make. Your lives may depend on it.'"
