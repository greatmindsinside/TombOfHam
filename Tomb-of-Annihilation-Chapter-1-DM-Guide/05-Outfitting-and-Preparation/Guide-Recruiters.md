## Environment and NPCs

**What to Say (Location: Tavern - Thundering Lizard or similar):**

> "The tavern is bustling with activity, but several individuals stand out from the crowd. They carry rolled maps, equipment lists, and have the bearing of people who organize expeditions. These are guide recruiters, and they're actively seeking clients.
>
> **Near the Bar:**
>
> A **recruiter** leans against the bar, casually observing newcomers as they enter. They're well-dressed but practical, with a leather satchel full of maps and documents. They make eye contact with you and give a friendly nod, clearly assessing whether you're potential clients.
>
> **At a Corner Table:**
>
> Another **recruiter** sits at a corner table with a **guide** they're representing. They're showing maps to a group of adventurers, pointing out routes and explaining different guide specialties.

## What to Say (Generic - Use Appropriate Location Description Above)

## What Players See

- Individuals with maps and equipment lists
- The bearing of professional expedition organizers
- Guides actively recruiting in taverns, markets, or near docks
- Multiple guide options being presented
- The importance of choosing the right guide
- Recruiters who may have their own agendas

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Listen to recruiter pitches** - Hear about available guides and their specialties
2. **Ask questions** - Inquire about guide experience, methods, and destinations
3. **Observe guides** - Use Perception/Investigation to assess reliability
4. **Research guide reputations** - Use Investigation to learn about past expeditions
5. **Read recruiter motivations** - Use Insight to detect hidden agendas
6. **Negotiate terms** - Use Persuasion to get better deals or more information
7. **Request interviews** - Ask to meet guides directly before deciding

## DM Guidance

Guide recruiters serve as an introduction to the guide selection process. They can be found in various locations (taverns, markets, docks) and actively approach newcomers. Use recruiters to present 2-3 guide options initially, making the selection process more accessible. Recruiters may have their own agendas (commissions, specific guide preferences) but should provide useful information. This is a natural way to introduce the guide selection process without requiring players to seek out Merchant Prince Kwayothe's office. Guide choice heavily influences Act 2 destinations and encounters.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about guide recruiters at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "A guide recruiter approaches you with a professional smile. 'New to Port Nyanzaru, are you? Planning an expedition into the jungle? Let me tell you what you absolutely must know:
>
> **First, guides are essential:** The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. A guide isn't optional - it's essential for survival. Even experienced adventurers can get lost or killed without proper guidance.
>
> **Second, what recruiters do:** We represent guides and help match expeditions with the right guide. We can introduce you to guides with different specialties - some know specific regions, others have connections with tribes or factions. We can arrange interviews, provide information about guide reputations, and help you make an informed choice.
>
> **Third, guide options:** Each guide has their own methods, knowledge, and specialties. Some know the rivers, some know the ruins, some know the tribes. Some are professional and reliable, others have hidden agendas. You need to choose based on where you want to go and what you want to accomplish. This is one of the most important decisions you'll make.
>
> **Fourth, the cost:** Guides typically charge 50-100 gp upfront, plus a share of any treasure found. This is a significant investment, but it's worth every coin. A good guide will save your life multiple times. A bad guide might cost you everything.
>
> **Fifth, how to choose:** Interview guides carefully. Ask about their experience, their methods, and what they expect from you. Use skill checks to verify their reputations and detect hidden agendas. Don't just take our word for it - do your own research. Your lives may depend on this choice.
>
> I can introduce you to several excellent guides right now, each with different specialties. Would you like to hear about them?'"

**When to Use This:** If players encounter a recruiter but need comprehensive information, if they're uncertain about the importance of guides, or after a very successful Investigation check (DC 18+)

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe recruiters and guides for signs of reliability

- **Success**: "You notice details about the recruiters and the guides they're promoting: the quality of their equipment, their bearing, how they present themselves. Some appear more professional and reliable than others. You can identify which guides seem trustworthy and which might be risky choices."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters and guides all seem capable, but you can't determine which ones are most reliable or experienced."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you can identify specific signs of experience (old scars, well-maintained equipment, confident bearing), detect signs of trouble (nervousness, poor equipment, suspicious behavior), and even notice subtle details that reveal each guide's true capabilities and potential problems. You can make an informed decision about which guide to consider."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research recruiter and guide reputations

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you can learn about the recruiters and the guides they're promoting: their past expeditions, their success rate, and what previous clients have said about them. You can identify which guides are reliable and which have problematic histories."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters' and guides' backgrounds are difficult to verify, and you can't determine their true reputations."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you learn about each recruiter's connections and motivations, each guide's complete history, their success and failure rates, their methods, and even rumors about their secrets or hidden agendas. You can identify which recruiters are honest brokers versus those pushing specific guides for their own reasons. You might even discover specific information about guide destinations or methods that helps you make a better choice."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read recruiters' true motivations and detect deception

- **Success**: "You can sense the recruiters' true motivations. Some are genuinely trying to help you find the right guide, while others may be pushing specific guides for commissions or other reasons. You can identify which recruiters are trustworthy and which you should approach with caution."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters seem helpful, but you can't determine their true motivations or if they're being completely honest."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific motivations (genuine helpfulness, commission-seeking, hidden agendas), identify when recruiters are exaggerating guide capabilities, sense which guides recruiters genuinely recommend versus those they're pushing for personal gain, and even predict how different recruiters will react to your questions. You can identify the best way to interact with each recruiter to get honest information."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Get recruiters to share honest information or better deals

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest help build rapport. The recruiters become more open, sharing additional information about guides, their methods, and potential concerns. They may even offer to arrange better terms or introduce you to guides not initially presented."
- **Failure**: "The recruiters remain polite but stick to their prepared pitches, sharing only basic information."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your approach is so effective that recruiters become genuinely helpful. They share valuable information about guide strengths and weaknesses, warn you about potential problems, offer to arrange interviews with multiple guides, and may even provide discounts or additional services. Some recruiters might introduce you to guides they normally wouldn't recommend, giving you more options."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information about guide recruiters or their organizations

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about guide recruitment in Port Nyanzaru. Some recruiters work independently, while others are associated with Merchant Prince Kwayothe's organization or the guide guild. Their reputations vary, and some are known to be more reliable than others."
- **Failure**: "You don't recall specific information about guide recruiters or their organizations."

## What Recruiters Say (Key Dialogue)

### Initial Approach

"'New to Port Nyanzaru, are you? Planning an expedition into the jungle? You'll need a guide - that's not optional, it's essential. The jungle kills the unprepared, and even experienced adventurers can get lost or worse without proper guidance. I represent several excellent guides, each with their own specialties. Let me introduce you to some options...'"

### About the Importance of Guides

"'The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Even the most experienced adventurers can get lost, fall to disease, or fall prey to the countless dangers that lurk in the undergrowth. A good guide doesn't just know the way - they know how to avoid danger, find water, treat disease, and navigate terrain that would kill the unprepared. Without a guide, your chances of survival drop dramatically.'"

### About Guide Selection

"'Each guide has their own methods, their own knowledge, and their own specialties. Some know the rivers, some know the ruins, some know the tribes. Choose based on where you want to go and what you want to accomplish. But remember - this is one of the most important decisions you'll make. Your lives may depend on it.'"
