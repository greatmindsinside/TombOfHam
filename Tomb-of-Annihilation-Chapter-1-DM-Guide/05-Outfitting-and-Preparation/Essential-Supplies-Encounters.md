Players encounter a merchant specializing in water storage containers, or a merchant emphasizes the critical importance of water during their shopping.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "A merchant with a stall full of water containers calls out to you. 'Water storage! You'll need proper containers for your expedition. The heat in the jungle will make you drink more than you think - a gallon per person per day is the minimum, and that's if you're lucky. In extreme heat, you'll need more. And these containers need to be sturdy - tropical storms can destroy flimsy containers, and losing your water means death in days.
>
> 'I've seen expeditions fail because they didn't bring enough water or their containers broke. You can't rely on finding clean water in the jungle - most sources are contaminated, and drinking from them means disease. You need to carry your water with you, and you need containers that won't break.
>
> 'These containers (2 cp per gallon) are made to withstand tropical conditions. They're worth every coin. How many gallons do you need? Remember: one gallon per person per day, minimum seven days. That's seven gallons per person, and you'll probably need more.'"

>
> 'I've supplied dozens of expeditions, and I can tell you: you'll need more food than you think. You'll get lost, waste days, and need reserves. One ration per person per day is the minimum, and that's for a week. But you should bring more - at least two weeks' worth if you can carry it.
>
> 'These rations (5 sp per day) are preserved to last in tropical conditions. They're not gourmet, but they'll keep you alive. Seven days per person is 3.5 gold pieces. But trust me - bring more if you can. The jungle has a way of making expeditions take longer than expected.'"

Mosquitoes in the jungle carry deadly diseases: shivering sickness, which causes fever and chills, and other tropical diseases that can kill you in days.
>
> 'Without protection, you'll be making daily Constitution saves against disease. Every day. And if you fail, you'll get sick, and sickness in the jungle is often fatal. Disease kills more adventurers than creatures do - I've seen strong warriors brought down by a single mosquito bite.
>

### Encounter Dialogue

> "A merchant with a stall full of tents approaches you. 'Shelter! You'll need tents for your expedition - and not just any tents. You need tents with insect netting. The jungle is full of insects that bite at night, and without protection, you'll be making disease saves even while you sleep.
>
> 'But more than that, you need shelter from the weather. Tropical storms hit almost daily - torrential rain that can destroy everything you own if you're not protected. The rain can last for hours, and without shelter, your gear gets soaked, your food spoils, and you risk hypothermia even in the heat.
>
> 'These tents (2 gp) are designed for tropical conditions. They have insect netting to keep bugs out, waterproof materials to keep rain out, and they're sturdy enough to withstand storms.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "A merchant with a stall full of water collection equipment calls out to you. 'Rain catchers! You can't carry all the water you'll need - it's too heavy. But the jungle provides water almost daily in the form of tropical storms. You just need a way to collect it.
>
> 'These rain catchers (5 gp) are designed for tropical conditions. They collect rainwater during storms, filter out debris, and store it safely. With a rain catcher, you can supplement your carried water and reduce the risk of running out.
>
> 'I've seen expeditions fail because they ran out of water. They had containers, but they didn't have a way to collect more. The jungle gives you water almost every day - you just need to be ready to catch it. A rain catcher can mean the difference between survival and death.'"

### Encounter Setup

### Encounter Dialogue

> "A merchant near the harbor or in the market approaches you. 'Planning to travel by river? You'll need a canoe. River travel is much faster and safer than walking through the jungle. You can cover more distance in a day, avoid many ground-based dangers, and carry more supplies.
>
> 'These canoes (50 gp) are designed for Chult's rivers. They're sturdy enough to handle rapids and shallow enough to navigate narrow channels. A canoe can carry your entire party plus supplies, and it's much faster than walking.
>
> 'I've seen expeditions take weeks to reach their destination on foot, but with a canoe, they can get there in days. Plus, you avoid many of the ground-based dangers - dinosaurs, undead, and hostile tribes. If you're traveling anywhere near a river, a canoe is worth every coin.'"
