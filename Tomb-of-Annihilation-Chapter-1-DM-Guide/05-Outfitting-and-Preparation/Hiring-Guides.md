## What to Say

> "Kwayothe gestures to several figures waiting in the antechamber. 'These are some of the best guides available in Port Nyanzaru. Each knows different parts of Chult and has their own... methods. They've all survived multiple expeditions, which is more than can be said for many who venture into the jungle.'
>
> She pauses, her expression serious. 'Choosing a guide is one of the most important decisions you'll make. The wrong guide can lead you into danger or abandon you when things get tough. The right guide can mean the difference between life and death in the jungle. Each of these guides has their strengths, their weaknesses, and their own reasons for taking on expeditions. Interview them carefully. Ask about their experience, their methods, and what they expect from you. Choose wisely - your lives may depend on it.'"

## What Players See

- Kwayothe's office or the guide guild
- Multiple guide candidates with distinct appearances and personalities
- Each guide's equipment, bearing, and demeanor
- The weight of an important decision
- Guides who may have hidden agendas or secrets

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Interview guides** - Ask questions about experience, methods, and destinations
2. **Observe guides** - Use Perception/Investigation to assess reliability
3. **Research guide reputations** - Use Investigation to learn about past expeditions
4. **Read guide motivations** - Use Insight to detect hidden agendas
5. **Negotiate terms** - Use Persuasion to get better deals or more information
6. **Make a choice** - Select a guide based on gathered information

## DM Guidance

Guide choice heavily influences Act 2 destinations and encounters. Present 3-4 options with distinct personalities. Make players feel the weight of this decision - it's one of the most important choices in Chapter 1. Encourage players to ask questions and interview guides. Each guide should have 1-2 secrets or agendas. Use skill checks to reveal information that helps players make informed decisions. Don't make any guide obviously "best" - each should have pros and cons. Guide choice affects available paths and encounters significantly. Guides provide local knowledge and survival skills. Make each guide's personality and methods distinct.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about hiring guides at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Kwayothe gestures to several figures waiting in the antechamber. 'These are some of the best guides available in Port Nyanzaru. Each knows different parts of Chult and has their own... methods. They've all survived multiple expeditions, which is more than can be said for many who venture into the jungle.'
>
> She pauses, her expression serious. 'Let me tell you what you absolutely must know about guides:
>
> **First, guides are essential - not optional:** The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. A guide isn't a luxury - it's essential for survival. Even experienced adventurers can get lost or killed without proper guidance.
>
> **Second, each guide is different:** Every guide has their own specialties, methods, and knowledge. Some know specific regions, others have connections with tribes or factions. Some are river guides, others know the jungle interior. Some are professional and reliable, others have hidden agendas. You need to choose based on where you want to go and what you want to accomplish.
>
> **Third, guide choice matters:** This is one of the most important decisions you'll make. The wrong guide can lead you into danger or abandon you when things get tough. The right guide can mean the difference between life and death. Interview them carefully. Ask about their experience, their methods, and what they expect from you. Use skill checks to verify their reputations and detect hidden agendas.
>
> **Fourth, what guides provide:** Guides provide navigation, survival skills, local knowledge, and connections. They know the dangers, the routes, the water sources, and how to avoid threats. They can help you find destinations, avoid hazards, and survive the jungle's challenges. But they also have their own motivations - some want treasure, some have tribal connections, some serve factions.
>
> **Fifth, the cost:** Guides typically charge 50-100 gp upfront, plus a share of any treasure found. This is a significant investment, but it's worth every coin. A good guide will save your life multiple times. A bad guide might cost you everything.
>
> Choose wisely - your lives may depend on it.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to hire a guide but need comprehensive information, if they're uncertain about the importance of guides, or after a very successful Investigation check (DC 18+)

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe guides for signs of experience or reliability

- **Success**: "You notice details about each guide: the quality of their equipment, scars from past adventures, how they carry themselves. Some appear more experienced and reliable than others. You can identify which guides seem trustworthy and which might be risky choices."
- **Failure**: "The guides all seem capable, but you can't determine which ones are most reliable or experienced."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you can identify specific signs of experience (old scars, well-maintained equipment, confident bearing), detect signs of trouble (nervousness, poor equipment, suspicious behavior), and even notice subtle details that reveal each guide's true capabilities and potential problems. You can make an informed decision about which guide to hire."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research guide reputations and backgrounds

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you can learn about each guide's reputation: their past expeditions, their success rate, and what previous clients have said about them. You can identify which guides are reliable and which have problematic histories."
- **Failure**: "The guides' backgrounds are difficult to verify, and you can't determine their true reputations."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you learn about each guide's complete history, their success and failure rates, their methods, and even rumors about their secrets or hidden agendas. You can identify which guides are genuinely helpful, which have ulterior motives, and which might be dangerous. You might even discover specific information about their destinations or methods that helps you make a better choice."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read guides' true motivations and detect deception

- **Success**: "You can sense each guide's true motivations. Some are genuinely helpful and experienced, while others might have hidden agendas or be less capable than they claim. You can identify which guides are being honest and which are hiding something."
- **Failure**: "The guides seem sincere, but you can't determine their true motivations or detect if they're being deceptive."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific motivations (greed, duty, personal agendas, desperation), identify when guides are lying or exaggerating their capabilities, sense hidden secrets or agendas, and even predict how each guide will behave in different situations. You can identify which guides will be reliable partners versus those who might cause problems."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Negotiate better terms or gather more information

- **Success**: "Your diplomatic approach helps you negotiate better terms, get more information about each guide, or convince them to be more open about their methods and expectations. Guides are more willing to share details or offer better deals."
- **Failure**: "The guides stick to their standard terms and aren't willing to negotiate or share additional information."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your negotiation is highly effective: you can secure significantly better terms (lower costs, better treasure splits, additional services), get guides to reveal more about their methods and secrets, and even convince them to provide upfront information about dangers or routes. Some guides might offer to provide additional resources or contacts."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information about guides or their reputations

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about some of these guides before. Their names or reputations ring a bell, and you can recall basic information about their past expeditions or methods."
- **Failure**: "The guides' names don't ring any bells, though they clearly have some experience."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you recall detailed information about each guide's past expeditions, their successes and failures, their methods, and even rumors about their secrets or agendas. This knowledge helps you make a more informed decision about which guide to hire."
