## What to Say

> "The Grand Souk is a maze of colorful stalls and bargaining merchants. Exotic spices scent the air, and vendors call out in a dozen languages. You can find almost anything here - from practical expedition gear to bizarre curiosities from across Chult.
>
> Merchants eye you appraisingly as you pass, recognizing newcomers who need to stock up for jungle expeditions. Some call out prices, others offer 'special deals for adventurers,' and a few simply watch, waiting for you to approach. The market is alive with the energy of commerce, but beneath the surface, you sense that every purchase matters - the wrong gear or the wrong merchant could mean the difference between survival and death in the jungle beyond."

## What Players Find

- The Grand Souk with countless merchants and stalls
- Essential supplies: food, water, insect repellent, tents, canoes
- Special Chultan items: tej, yklwa, insect repellent paste
- Merchants of varying quality and honesty
- The importance of proper preparation for jungle travel

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Shop for essentials** - Buy food, water, insect repellent, and basic gear
2. **Research needed supplies** - Use Survival checks to identify what's essential
3. **Compare prices** - Use Investigation to find the best deals
4. **Negotiate with merchants** - Use Persuasion to get better prices

## DM Guidance

This phase teaches resource management for jungle travel. Let players shop and ask questions. Use shopping to show local culture and provide information through merchant conversations. Balance between providing necessary supplies and creating resource management challenges. Essential items (food, water, insect repellent) should be available but emphasize their importance. Use merchants to provide rumors or complications. Don't make shopping a chore - make it engaging with colorful descriptions and interesting NPCs. Use shopping encounters to introduce NPCs or provide information.
