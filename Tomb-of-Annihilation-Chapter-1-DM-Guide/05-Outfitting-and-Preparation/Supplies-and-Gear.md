## What to Say (When Entering the Market)

## What Players Find

- The Grand Souk with countless merchants and stalls
- Essential supplies: food, water, insect repellent, tents, canoes
- Special Chultan items: tej, yklwa, insect repellent paste
- Merchants of varying quality and honesty
- The importance of proper preparation for jungle travel

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Shop for essentials** - Buy food, water, insect repellent, and basic gear
2. **Research needed supplies** - Use Survival checks to identify what's essential
3. **Compare prices** - Use Investigation to find the best deals
4. **Negotiate with merchants** - Use Persuasion to get better prices
5. **Seek special items** - Look for magic items or Chultan specialties
6. **Avoid scams** - Use Insight to detect dishonest merchants

## DM Guidance

This phase teaches resource management for jungle travel. Let players shop and ask questions. Use shopping to show local culture and provide information through merchant conversations. Balance between providing necessary supplies and creating resource management challenges. Essential items (food, water, insect repellent) should be available but emphasize their importance. Use merchants to provide rumors or complications. Don't make shopping a chore - make it engaging with colorful descriptions and interesting NPCs. Use shopping encounters to introduce NPCs or provide information.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about supplies at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "A serious merchant pulls you aside in the Grand Souk. 'Before you buy anything, let me tell you what you absolutely must have for jungle travel. I've supplied dozens of expeditions, and I've seen what happens when people don't prepare properly.
>
> **First, the essentials you cannot skip:**
>
> - **Food rations** (5 sp per day): One per person per day, minimum one week's supply. More is better - you'll get lost, waste days, and need reserves. That's 3.5 gp per person for 7 days.
> - **Water containers** (2 cp per gallon): One gallon per person per day, minimum. More in extreme heat. You need storage that won't break - storms destroy flimsy containers. That's 1.4 gp per person for 7 days (7 gallons).
> - **Insect repellent** (1 gp): This is non-negotiable. Mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. Without protection, you'll be making daily saves against disease. Disease kills more adventurers than creatures do.
> - **Tents** (2 gp): Not optional. You need shelter from weather and insects. Tropical storms can destroy everything you own. Extreme heat causes exhaustion.
> - **Rain catchers** (5 gp): Essential for collecting water during storms. You can't carry all the water you'll need.
>
> **Second, what happens if you're missing supplies:** Missing food means starvation and exhaustion. Missing water means death in days. Missing insect repellent means disease - daily saves that can kill you. Missing shelter means exposure to weather that can destroy your gear and kill you. Missing any essential supply could mean death.
>
> **Third, additional useful items:** Canoes (50 gp) for river travel (faster and safer than walking), pack animals or porters for carrying gear (varies), extra rope (1 gp for 50 ft) and tools, torches (1 cp each) or light sources, and specialized Chultan items like insect repellent paste (5 gp) from Merchant Prince Jessamine.
>
> **Fourth, the reality of jungle travel:** You can't carry everything. Supplies are heavy. You'll lose gear. You'll waste days getting lost. The jungle will use more resources than you expect. Buy more than you think you need, because you'll need more than you think.
>
> **Fifth, where to buy:** The Grand Souk has everything you need. Compare prices, verify quality, and don't be afraid to negotiate. But don't skimp on essentials - the jungle doesn't forgive mistakes.
>
> Don't skimp on these. The jungle will kill you if you're not prepared.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are shopping but don't understand what they need, if they're trying to save money by skipping essentials, or after a very successful Survival check (DC 16+)
