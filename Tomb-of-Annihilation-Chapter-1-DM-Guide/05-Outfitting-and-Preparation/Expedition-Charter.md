## What to Say

> "The Flaming Fist captain eyes you appraisingly from behind a desk cluttered with maps and reports. The office is functional and military, with weapons and armor displayed on the walls. 'So you're heading into the jungle to deal with this Soulmonger business?' he says, his tone measured and professional. 'Sounds like the Merchant Princes are involved somehow. Very well - I'll grant you an expedition charter. It won't make the jungle any safer, but it might keep some of the more... opportunistic locals off your back.'
>
> He produces an official document, stamping it with the Flaming Fist seal. 'This charter recognizes you as legitimate explorers, not looters or treasure hunters. It gives you some legal protection, but remember - we'll be watching. Abuse this privilege, and you'll answer to us.'"
