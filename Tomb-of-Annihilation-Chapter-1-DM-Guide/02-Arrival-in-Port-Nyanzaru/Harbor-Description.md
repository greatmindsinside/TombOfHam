## First Impressions

Read this description aloud as the party arrives and takes in their surroundings.

**Location:** Port Nyanzaru Harbor

## What to Say

> "The port of Port Nyanzaru is a riot of color and activity. Brightly painted buildings in every hue line the waterfront - turquoise, crimson, gold, and emerald structures that seem to glow in the tropical sun. The air shimmers with heat and humidity, carrying the mingled scents of salt water, exotic spices, and something earthy and reptilian.
>
> Massive dinosaurs lumber through the streets, some pulling heavily laden wagons, others bearing riders in elaborate saddles. Smaller reptiles dart between the legs of merchants and sailors. The docks themselves are a cacophony of sound: vendors shouting in multiple languages, the creak of ropes and timbers, the splash of waves against hulls, and the occasional bellow or chirp from the beasts of burden.
>
> Ships from across Faerûn crowd the harbor - sleek Chultan longships with dragon-headed prows, sturdy Cormyrean galleys, and even a few Shou Lung junks. The city feels alive, thriving, and utterly alien compared to the temperate ports of the Sword Coast. This is clearly a place where wealth and danger walk hand in hand."

## DM Guidance

This is the players' first real look at Port Nyanzaru. Emphasize the exotic, vibrant nature of the city and the integration of dinosaurs. Use skill checks to reveal information about the city's culture, trade, and dangers. The harbor is a good place for players to gather initial information and get their bearings. Once they've taken in the scene, transition to the city overview or let them choose their next destination.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Scan the harbor for security or unusual activity

- **Success**: "Amidst the bustling activity, you spot several well-armed guards patrolling the docks. Some wear the tabards of the Flaming Fist mercenary company, while others bear the symbols of local merchant princes. The city takes its security seriously - Port Nyanzaru may be welcoming, but it's not naive about potential threats."
- **Failure**: "The harbor is so busy and chaotic that it's difficult to get a clear picture of the security situation. Guards blend into the crowd, and you can't determine if the security is adequate or if threats are being overlooked."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you identify three distinct guard forces (Flaming Fist, merchant prince guards, and city watch), note their patrol patterns, spot several hidden watch posts on rooftops, and even notice a few undercover agents monitoring the crowd. The security is layered and professional. You also spot a few individuals who seem to be avoiding the guards - potential criminals or people with something to hide."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine the ships and cargo for clues about trade

- **Success**: "Looking at the various ships, you notice that many carry exotic cargo - crates marked with Chultan symbols, cages containing colorful birds, and barrels that smell of unfamiliar spices. Several ships bear damage from what looks like recent storms or encounters with sea creatures. Trade with Chult is lucrative but clearly dangerous."
- **Failure**: "The ships and cargo are too numerous and varied to analyze effectively. You can tell trade is active, but the specifics elude you."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: specific trade goods (rare Chultan woods, dinosaur hides, exotic fruits, and what appears to be ancient artifacts), the damage patterns suggest encounters with both storms and large sea creatures (possibly plesiosaurs or similar), and you notice several ships flying flags of major trading companies. Most interestingly, you spot a ship being unloaded that carries expedition supplies - tents, rations, and equipment clearly meant for jungle travel, suggesting organized expeditions are common."

**DC 14 Perception Check**: Listen for rumors or conversations among dockworkers

- **Success**: "Overhearing snippets of conversation among the dockworkers, you catch mentions of 'the curse,' 'dead magic,' and 'jungle expeditions gone wrong.' The sailors speak in hushed tones about recent disappearances and failed attempts to reach the interior. The Death Curse is clearly affecting even the seafarers here."
- **Failure**: "The noise of the harbor makes it impossible to pick out individual conversations. You hear general chatter but nothing specific."
- **Critical Success (19+)**: "You catch detailed conversations: a group of sailors discussing a ship that returned with only half its crew after encountering 'something in the mist,' dockworkers warning each other about a guide who led an expedition into the jungle and never returned, and merchants complaining about decreased trade due to the Death Curse affecting their regular customers. Most importantly, you overhear someone mention 'the old city' and 'the thing that eats souls' - clearly referring to the Soulmonger."

### Passive Checks

**Passive Perception 14**: Notice pickpockets or suspicious activity

- **Success**: "You notice a few individuals moving through the crowd with suspicious behavior - hands too quick, eyes scanning for opportunities rather than focusing on their tasks. The harbor has its share of thieves, and you're aware of potential targets."
- **If Passive Perception is below 14**: The player may be targeted by pickpockets, requiring an active Perception check to notice.

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Nature Check**: Identify dinosaur species and their uses

- **Success**: "You can identify several dinosaur species: large triceratops being used as beasts of burden, smaller deinonychus being led by handlers (likely for racing or hunting), and various herbivorous species. The dinosaurs appear well-trained and integrated into the city's economy."
- **Failure**: "The dinosaurs are clearly important to the city, but you can't identify the specific species or their purposes."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your knowledge allows you to identify multiple species and their specific uses: triceratops for heavy labor, hadrosaurs for transportation, deinonychus for racing and hunting, and even a few ankylosaurs being used as mobile defensive platforms. You notice the training methods being used and can identify which handlers are experienced versus novices. You also spot a few species that seem out of place - possibly newly captured or being prepared for export."

**DC 12 Survival Check**: Assess the climate and prepare for heat/humidity

- **Success**: "The climate is immediately oppressive - high heat and extreme humidity. You'll need to stay hydrated, seek shade regularly, and likely need to adjust your clothing and equipment for the tropical environment. Dehydration and heat exhaustion are real concerns here."
- **Failure**: "The heat is noticeable, but you can't determine the full implications for survival and travel."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your survival assessment is detailed: the temperature is in the high 90s with near 100% humidity, creating a heat index that's dangerous for extended exposure. You'll need at least twice the normal water consumption, lighter clothing, protection from the sun, and regular rest periods. The humidity means sweat won't evaporate effectively, making cooling difficult. You also notice the locals have adapted - they work in shifts, stay in shade during peak heat, and have developed specific clothing and equipment for the climate. You can identify what supplies you'll need to purchase."

**DC 13 Insight Check**: Read the mood of dockworkers and merchants

- **Success**: "The dockworkers and merchants show a mix of emotions: business is good, but there's underlying tension. People are making money, but they're also worried. The Death Curse is affecting their customers and trade partners, and there's a sense that things are getting worse, not better."
- **Failure**: "The crowd's mood is difficult to read - people seem busy and focused on their work."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "You read the emotional landscape clearly: merchants are anxious about the future (the Death Curse is killing their best customers), dockworkers are overworked (more ships arriving as people flee to or seek answers in Chult), and there's a general sense of desperation mixed with opportunity. Some people are clearly profiting from the crisis, while others are suffering. You can identify which individuals might be helpful (those genuinely concerned) versus those to avoid (opportunists looking to exploit newcomers)."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recognize ship designs and their origins

- **Success**: "You can identify ships from various regions: Chultan longships with their distinctive dragon-headed prows, Cormyrean galleys with their sturdy construction, Shou Lung junks with their unique rigging, and even a few ships from the Sword Coast. The diversity shows Port Nyanzaru is a major trading hub."
- **Failure**: "The ships come from many places, but you can't identify their specific origins."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your knowledge of naval architecture is comprehensive: you identify not just the ship types but specific regional variations, can estimate their cargo capacity and capabilities, and recognize several ships from famous trading companies. You notice one ship flying colors you don't recognize - possibly a new trading company or a private expedition. Most interestingly, you spot a ship that appears to be a converted warship, suggesting someone is taking the dangers of Chult very seriously."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Approach dockworkers for information

- **Success**: "The dockworkers are initially wary, but your friendly approach and a few well-placed questions get them talking. They share that business has been booming lately, with many expeditions heading into the jungle, though few return. They mention that guides are in high demand and that the Death Curse has everyone on edge."
- **Failure**: "The dockworkers are too busy or suspicious to share information. They give you curt responses and quickly return to their work, possibly viewing you as just another naive adventurer."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your approach is so effective that the dockworkers become quite talkative. They share valuable information: which guides are reliable versus which to avoid, recent expedition routes that have been successful, rumors about the 'old city' in the jungle interior, and even the name of a tavern where expedition organizers gather. One dockworker even offers to introduce you to a guide they trust, saying 'You seem like the serious type, not like those fools who think they can just walk into the jungle.'" → *This guide contact will be useful*: [Hiring-Guides.md](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Hiring-Guides.md), *and the tavern information*: [Gathering-Information.md](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Gathering-Information.md)
