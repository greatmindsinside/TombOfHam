## What to Say

> "As you take in your surroundings, Port Nyanzaru sprawls before you - a vibrant, chaotic city unlike any you've seen. The streets are a riot of color, with buildings painted in every shade imaginable: turquoise, crimson, gold, and emerald structures that seem to glow in the tropical sun. The air shimmers with heat and humidity, and the sounds of the city wash over you in waves.
>
> Everywhere you look, life teems. Dinosaurs of all sizes move through the streets - massive triceratops pulling wagons, sleek deinonychus being led by handlers, and smaller reptiles darting between the legs of merchants and sailors. The docks are a cacophony of activity: vendors shouting in multiple languages, the creak of ropes and timbers, the splash of waves, and the occasional bellow or chirp from the beasts of burden.
>
> The city feels alive, thriving, and utterly alien compared to the temperate ports of the Sword Coast. This is clearly a place where wealth and danger walk hand in hand, where civilization has carved out a precarious existence on the edge of a deadly wilderness."

## DM Guidance

This is the party's first chance to explore. Let them choose their direction, but be prepared to provide hooks and encounters based on their choices. The city serves as a "tutorial zone" where they learn about Chult, gather information, and prepare for the jungle.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe the city defenses and layout

- **Success**: "From your vantage point, you can see that Port Nyanzaru is well-fortified. High walls surround the city, with watchtowers and guard posts at regular intervals. The harbor entrance is narrow and easily defended. Despite the welcoming atmosphere, the city is clearly prepared for siege - a necessity when surrounded by deadly jungle."
- **Failure**: "The city appears well-built, but you can't get a clear sense of its defensive capabilities or layout from your current position."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you identify multiple defensive layers (outer walls, inner fortifications, harbor defenses), note the strategic placement of watchtowers covering all approaches, spot defensive positions designed to repel both land and sea attacks, and notice that the city has clearly been designed with jungle warfare in mind. The defenses suggest the city has faced serious threats before and is prepared for them to return."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Study the city's architecture and construction

- **Success**: "The buildings show a mix of Chultan and foreign architectural styles. Many structures incorporate dinosaur motifs in their carvings, and the construction techniques suggest a blend of local materials with imported building methods. The city has clearly benefited from extensive trade and foreign investment."
- **Failure**: "The architecture is interesting but complex - you can't determine the specific styles or their significance."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your architectural analysis reveals detailed information: the city has distinct districts with different architectural styles (Chultan native, Cormyrean colonial, and newer mixed styles), the dinosaur motifs follow specific patterns suggesting religious or cultural significance, and you can identify which buildings are oldest (showing more Chultan influence) versus newest (showing more foreign investment). The construction quality varies significantly, with some areas clearly more prosperous than others. You also notice several buildings that appear to be temples or shrines, suggesting religion plays an important role in the city."

**DC 14 Investigation Check**: Look for signs of the Death Curse's impact

- **Success**: "Though the city appears thriving, you notice subtle signs of strain. Some buildings show recent hasty repairs, and you spot a few individuals with the telltale withering marks of the Death Curse trying to conceal their condition. The merchant stalls have fewer resurrection-related items than you'd expect in a typical city."
- **Failure**: "The city seems normal, though you suspect there might be signs of the Death Curse's impact that you're missing."
- **Critical Success (19+)**: "Your investigation reveals extensive evidence: multiple buildings show signs of recent abandonment or repurposing (likely former resurrection temples now closed), you spot several individuals with advanced Death Curse symptoms being discreetly cared for, merchant stalls that once sold resurrection scrolls now display 'out of stock' signs permanently, and you notice an increase in funerary services and grave goods. Most tellingly, you see several groups of adventurers and guides actively recruiting for expeditions, suggesting many are desperate to find a cure before it's too late."

### Passive Checks

**Passive Perception 13**: Notice guide recruiters or expedition organizers

- **Success**: "You notice several individuals who stand out from the crowd - they're actively approaching newcomers, carrying maps and equipment lists, and have the bearing of people who organize expeditions. These are likely guides or expedition organizers looking for clients."
- **If Passive Perception is below 13**: The player may need to actively seek out guides or may be approached by less reputable recruiters.

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 History Check**: Recall information about Port Nyanzaru's founding

- **Success**: "Port Nyanzaru was founded as a trading outpost by Chultan natives and foreign traders seeking to exploit Chult's resources. It grew into the only major civilized settlement on the peninsula, serving as a gateway between the dangerous interior and the rest of Faerûn. The city has survived numerous threats, including jungle incursions, pirate attacks, and internal conflicts between merchant princes."
- **Failure**: "You know Port Nyanzaru is an important trading city, but the specific historical details elude you."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: Port Nyanzaru was founded approximately 200 years ago when a group of Chultan tribes and foreign traders established a permanent settlement. The city has been ruled by merchant princes (originally seven, now varying in number) who control different aspects of trade. The city has survived multiple crises, including a major dinosaur stampede 50 years ago, several pirate sieges, and conflicts with jungle tribes. The current prosperity is relatively recent, built on the city's role as the primary gateway for expeditions into Chult's interior - a role that has become even more important since the Death Curse began."

**DC 12 Religion Check**: Identify temple symbols and their deities

- **Success**: "You can identify several temple symbols: the symbol of Tymora (goddess of luck, popular with adventurers), the symbol of Waukeen (goddess of trade, fitting for a merchant city), and what appears to be a local Chultan deity (possibly Ubtao, the creator god of Chult). The temples suggest a mix of foreign and native religious practices."
- **Failure**: "You see various religious symbols, but you can't identify the specific deities or their significance."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your religious knowledge allows you to identify multiple temples: Tymora's temple (likely popular with adventurers seeking luck), Waukeen's temple (central to the merchant culture), a temple to Ubtao (the ancient creator god of Chult, though it appears less active than the others), and even a small shrine to Kelemvor (god of death, which has likely seen increased activity due to the Death Curse). You notice that the temples to life and resurrection deities appear closed or converted, while death-related temples are more active. This confirms the Death Curse's impact on the city's religious life."

**DC 13 Insight Check**: Sense political tensions between merchant princes

- **Success**: "You can sense underlying political currents. While the city appears unified on the surface, there are subtle signs of competition and tension. Different areas of the city seem to be controlled by different factions, and you notice people avoiding certain areas or showing deference to specific individuals. The merchant princes clearly have their own territories and interests."
- **Failure**: "The city seems politically stable, though you suspect there might be tensions you're not picking up on."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your insight reveals detailed political dynamics: you can identify which areas belong to which merchant prince based on the symbols, guards, and architecture, you notice subtle conflicts (merchants avoiding certain districts, guards from different princes giving each other cold stares), and you sense that the Death Curse has created new opportunities for political maneuvering. Some merchant princes are clearly profiting from the increased expedition traffic, while others may be struggling. You can identify which princes might be helpful allies versus potential obstacles." → *This political knowledge will be useful*: [Power-Structure.md](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Power-Structure.md)

**DC 10 Nature Check**: Identify dangerous flora/fauna visible from city walls

- **Success**: "From the city walls, you can see the jungle beyond is dense and teeming with life. You spot various dangerous-looking plants (carnivorous species, thorny vines, and what might be poisonous fungi) and catch glimpses of large predators moving in the treetops. The jungle is clearly hostile and requires careful navigation."
- **Failure**: "The jungle looks dangerous, but you can't identify specific threats from this distance."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your nature knowledge allows you to identify specific threats: man-eating plants (likely assassin vines or similar), poisonous flora that could cause paralysis or death, and you can hear and occasionally spot large predators (possibly tyrannosaurs or similar apex predators). You also notice the jungle's edge shows signs of recent activity - cleared paths that have already been reclaimed by the jungle, suggesting expeditions have passed through recently. The density and diversity of dangerous species suggest the jungle interior will be extremely hazardous."

**DC 12 Survival Check**: Assess what supplies will be needed for jungle travel

- **Success**: "Based on the climate and jungle conditions, you'll need: ample water (the heat and humidity will cause rapid dehydration), insect repellent (the jungle is full of disease-carrying insects), proper clothing (light but protective), food that won't spoil in the heat, and navigation equipment. You'll also need guides who know the terrain and can identify safe routes."
- **Failure**: "You know you'll need supplies, but you can't determine the specific requirements."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your survival assessment is comprehensive: you'll need at least 1 gallon of water per person per day (more in extreme heat), specialized insect repellent (standard varieties won't work against Chult's aggressive insects), lightweight but durable clothing that protects from sun and insects, preserved rations (fresh food will spoil quickly), navigation tools (compasses may be unreliable due to magical interference), and most importantly, a knowledgeable guide. You also identify that you'll need: rain catchers (daily tropical storms), tents with insect netting, fire-starting equipment (wet conditions make fires difficult), and medical supplies for treating tropical diseases. You can estimate the cost and where to purchase these items in the city." → *Use this knowledge when shopping*: [Supplies-and-Gear.md](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Supplies-and-Gear.md)

**DC 11 Arcana Check**: Detect magical wards or protections on the city

- **Success**: "You can sense powerful magical protections around the city. There are defensive wards on the walls, likely designed to repel both magical and physical attacks. The magic feels old and well-maintained, suggesting the city has invested significant resources in its protection."
- **Failure**: "You sense magic around the city, but you can't determine its specific nature or purpose."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your arcane analysis reveals detailed information: the city is protected by multiple layers of magical wards (abjuration magic for defense, divination magic for early warning, and even some transmutation magic that may affect the city's climate). The wards are sophisticated and clearly maintained by skilled spellcasters. You also detect that some areas have stronger protections than others (likely merchant prince compounds and important buildings), and you sense a subtle magical barrier that may prevent certain types of creatures from entering the city. Most interestingly, you notice the wards have been recently reinforced, suggesting the city is preparing for increased threats - possibly related to the Death Curse or increased expedition activity disturbing things in the jungle."
