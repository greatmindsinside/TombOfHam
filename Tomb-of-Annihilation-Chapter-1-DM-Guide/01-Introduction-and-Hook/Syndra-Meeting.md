# The Syndra Silvane Meeting Scene

*Syndra meeting scene: **pp. 7-8***

## Scene Description

Syndra Silvane is a former adventurer dying from the Death Curse. She approaches the party with a desperate proposition.

## Key Points to Cover

- **Her Background**: Former adventurer, now cursed
- **The Problem**: Death Curse affecting the world, tied to Soulmonger in Chult
- **The Offer**: 5,000 gold pieces, magic items, teleportation to Port Nyanzaru
- **The Stakes**: If they don't destroy the Soulmonger, the curse will spread and kill millions

**Location:** Wherever the party begins (tavern, meeting hall, or other starting location)

## What to Say

> "Before you stands a woman in her middle years, her skin pale and drawn, with dark circles under her eyes. Withered patches mark her flesh where the Death Curse has taken hold. Despite her weakened state, there's a fire in her eyes - the determination of someone who's faced death before and refused to yield.
>
> 'Adventurers,' she says, her voice hoarse but steady. 'You've heard the rumors, haven't you? The dead stay dead. Resurrection magic fails. And those of us brought back from death's door... we're withering away.'
>
> She pulls back her sleeve, revealing a withered, necrotic arm. 'This curse affects the entire world. But I know its source: a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, hidden in the jungles of Chult. I was part of an expedition that found it once... and barely escaped with our lives.'
>
> 'I offer you 5,000 gold pieces now, plus whatever magic items you need from my collection, and my eternal gratitude. I'll teleport you directly to Port Nyanzaru, the only safe city in Chult. Find the Soulmonger. Destroy it. Save us all.'
>
> She looks at each of you imploringly. 'Will you accept this quest?'"

## DM Guidance

This is the detailed meeting scene. Allow players to interact with Syndra naturally - ask questions, negotiate, and use skill checks. Syndra is desperate but experienced, so she'll negotiate if players are reasonable. Use skill checks to reveal her background, condition, and hidden information. Once they accept and terms are agreed upon, transition to the teleportation scene. If players are hesitant, emphasize the stakes and urgency without railroading.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe Syndra's physical condition closely

- **Success**: "Beyond the obvious withering effects of the Death Curse, you notice Syndra bears several old scars that speak of a life spent adventuring - a jagged scar across her cheek, calluses on her hands from weapon use, and a slight limp that she tries to conceal. Despite her weakened state, her eyes remain sharp and alert."
- **Failure**: "Syndra's condition is clearly dire, but the details of her physical state are difficult to assess. She's clearly suffering, but you can't determine much beyond the obvious withering effects."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "You notice extremely fine details: the pattern of the withering suggests it's spreading from old wounds and scars, her breathing is slightly labored despite her attempts to hide it, and there's a faint necrotic smell that suggests the curse is more advanced than she's letting on. Her hands tremble slightly when she's not actively controlling them, indicating she has less time than she claims."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine Syndra's equipment and mannerisms

- **Success**: "Syndra's adventuring gear, while well-maintained, shows signs of recent hasty repairs. The leather armor has fresh stitching, and some of her pouches appear recently restocked. Her confident demeanor and detailed knowledge of the Soulmonger suggest she's not just a desperate victim, but someone with genuine expertise in dealing with such artifacts."
- **Failure**: "Syndra's equipment looks well-maintained, but you can't determine much about her background or expertise from a casual examination."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "The equipment tells a story: her armor bears marks from both blade and claw, suggesting encounters with both humanoid and monstrous foes. The pouches contain specialized tools for dealing with undead and necromantic magic. Her weapon shows signs of being blessed or enchanted specifically for fighting undead. Most tellingly, you spot a partially burned map of Chult's interior with several locations marked - including one labeled 'Soulmonger' with a question mark, suggesting she knows approximately where it is but not the exact location."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read Syndra's emotional state and desperation level

- **Success**: "Syndra is genuinely desperate, but not panicked. There's a calculated urgency to her words - she's been planning this approach. She's hiding something, but it's not malicious. More likely, she's protecting you from information that might make you refuse the quest. Her desperation is real, but so is her determination."
- **Failure**: "Syndra seems desperate and sincere, but you can't read much beyond the obvious emotional state."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "You see through her carefully maintained composure. Beneath the desperation is deep grief - she's lost someone important to the curse, likely a companion from her previous expedition. Her determination isn't just about saving herself, but about preventing others from suffering the same loss. She's also afraid - not of death, but of failing to stop the Soulmonger. There's a hint of guilt, as if she blames herself for the artifact's current state."

**DC 12 History Check**: Recall Syndra's reputation as an adventurer

- **Success**: "The name Syndra Silvane rings a bell. She was part of a well-known adventuring company that made a name for itself dealing with undead threats and necromantic artifacts. If she says she's encountered the Soulmonger before, she's likely telling the truth." *(Note: Specific company name "Golden Company" is DM-created content - verify against official source pp. 7-8)*
- **Failure**: "The name doesn't immediately come to mind, though she clearly has the bearing of someone with significant adventuring experience."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Syndra Silvane was a respected adventurer who led expeditions dealing with undead and necromantic threats. Her previous expedition to Chult ended with only a few survivors, and she has detailed knowledge of the dangers there. This gives her story significant credibility." *(Note: Specific details about "Golden Company" and expedition timeline are DM-created - verify against official source pp. 7-8)*

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Negotiate better terms (if attempted)

- **Success**: "Syndra considers your request carefully. 'Very well,' she says, 'I can increase the upfront payment to 7,500 gold, and I'll provide you with a letter of credit that will grant you access to my contacts in Port Nyanzaru. They can provide additional supplies and information at a discount.'"
- **Failure**: "Syndra shakes her head. 'I'm offering everything I can spare. The 5,000 gold is most of my remaining wealth, and the magic items I'm offering are from my personal collection. I cannot offer more without leaving myself destitute.'"
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Impressed by your negotiation, Syndra makes an additional offer: 'I see you understand the value of what I'm asking. In addition to the increased payment, I'll give you my personal journal from the previous expedition. It contains detailed notes about the dangers we encountered and the approximate location of the Soulmonger. I'll also provide you with a sending stone so we can communicate once you're in Chult, and I'll use my contacts to arrange for a trusted guide to meet you in Port Nyanzaru.'" → *This journal and guide contact will be useful in Port Nyanzaru*: [Hiring-Guides.md](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Hiring-Guides.md), [Gathering-Information.md](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Gathering-Information.md)

**DC 14 Arcana Check**: Sense magical auras around Syndra (curses, protective spells)

- **Success**: "You can sense multiple magical auras around Syndra. The strongest is a powerful necromantic curse - the Death Curse itself, which feels like a dark, consuming energy slowly eating away at her life force. You also detect several protective spells, likely attempts to slow the curse's progress, though they're clearly failing."
- **Failure**: "You sense magic around Syndra, but the specific nature of the auras is unclear. There's definitely something wrong, but you can't identify the exact magical effects."
- **Critical Success (19+)**: "The magical analysis reveals disturbing details: the Death Curse isn't just killing her - it's actively drawing her soul toward something. There's a faint connection, like a magical tether, stretching southward toward Chult. The protective spells she's using are actually making things worse by fighting the curse, creating a feedback loop. The curse itself feels ancient and powerful, far beyond what a typical artifact should be capable of. This suggests the Soulmonger is either incredibly old or has been significantly enhanced since her last encounter with it." → *This knowledge about the curse's nature may be crucial later*

**DC 10 Medicine Check**: Assess the severity of Syndra's condition

- **Success**: "Based on the visible symptoms and her general condition, Syndra likely has between two to four months before the Death Curse claims her completely. The withering is progressing steadily, and while she's still functional, her body is clearly deteriorating. She's in constant pain, though she's managing to hide it well."
- **Failure**: "Syndra is clearly very ill, but you can't determine the exact severity or timeline of her condition."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "The medical assessment is grim: Syndra has perhaps six to eight weeks at most. The curse is accelerating, and the withering pattern suggests it's targeting her vital organs. She's likely experiencing internal bleeding and organ failure. Her determination to continue functioning is remarkable, but she's pushing herself far beyond what her body can handle. Without destroying the Soulmonger soon, she won't survive to see the results of your mission."
