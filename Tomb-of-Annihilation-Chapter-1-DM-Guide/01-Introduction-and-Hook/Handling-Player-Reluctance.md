# Handling Player Reluctance: Railroading Techniques

*Note: This file contains DM techniques and advice that are not from the official source material. These are tools to help DMs handle player choices that deviate from the expected campaign flow.*

*Official source: Syndra meeting scene: **pp. 7-8***  
*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

*When players decline or delay the main quest, use these techniques to guide them toward acceptance while maintaining agency and fun.*

## The Problem

Players may decline the quest for various reasons:

- Fear of high-level danger
- Desire for different adventures
- Meta-knowledge of Tomb of Annihilation's reputation
- Character motivations that conflict with the hook
- Group dynamics or player preferences

## Core Philosophy

**Don't force acceptance through mechanics** - Instead, create compelling narrative pressure that makes acceptance feel like the natural, desirable choice. Players should feel they're making the decision, not that it's being made for them.

## Technique 1: Immediate Consequences

### Personal Stakes

- **Syndra's Condition**: Have Syndra visibly deteriorate during negotiations. "As you speak, you notice Syndra's skin growing paler, her breathing more labored. 'Please... I don't have much time.'"
- **Visible Suffering**: Point out NPCs with Death Curse symptoms in the tavern/inn where the meeting occurs.

### Environmental Pressure

- **Tavern Atmosphere**: Have other patrons react negatively to the rejection. "Several people in the tavern overhear your refusal. A woman with withered hands glares at you, while a man with curse marks mutters 'selfish bastards' under his breath."
- **Public Scene**: If the meeting is in a public place, make the rejection noticeable, creating social consequences.

## Technique 2: Escalating Threats

### The Curse Spreads

- **Immediate Effect**: Show the curse affecting someone the players care about or respect. "As you leave the tavern, you hear a scream from outside. A guard who was perfectly healthy moments ago collapses, the Death Curse claiming another victim."
- **Personal Connection**: If players have established relationships with NPCs, have those NPCs be affected.

### Time Pressure

- **Syndra's Timeline**: "Syndra gives you 1d4 days to decide, after which she'll seek other adventurers. During this time, show the curse worsening in the community."
- **Worsening Situation**: Each day of delay, introduce new victims or complications from the spreading curse.

## Technique 3: Alternative Hooks

### Side Quests First

- **Investigative Path**: Let players investigate the curse themselves, discovering evidence that leads them to Chult.
- **Personal Motivation**: Create personal stakes - a player character's loved one is affected, or they discover a connection to their backstory.
- **Mercenary Work**: Offer immediate, lucrative jobs that coincidentally lead toward Chult (monster hunting, artifact recovery).

### Moral Dilemmas

- **Save the Innocent**: Present opportunities to help curse victims, building empathy for the larger cause.
- **Prevent Greater Evil**: Reveal hints that the Soulmonger is growing in power and will soon become unstoppable.

## Technique 4: Mechanical Pressure

### Skill Check Revelations

Use successful skill checks to reveal compelling information:

**DC 15 Investigation**: Discover that the curse is accelerating - "Your investigation reveals that the Death Curse is spreading faster than previously thought. What started as isolated incidents is now affecting entire communities."

**DC 14 Insight on Syndra**: "You sense that Syndra is holding back information about what happens if the Soulmonger isn't destroyed soon - something truly catastrophic."

**DC 13 Religion**: "The curse is disrupting the natural order. Souls are being trapped, unable to reach their afterlife. This isn't just killing people - it's dooming them to eternal torment."

### Failed Check Consequences

When players fail checks, don't just say "you learn nothing" - instead: "Your investigation turns up disturbing rumors of people being resurrected as mindless undead, or souls being consumed entirely."

## Technique 5: Social Pressure

### Group Dynamics

- **Split Party**: If some players want to accept and others don't, create situations where the accepting players get benefits or information that the reluctant ones miss.
- **Peer Pressure**: Have NPCs question the group's decision. "Other adventurers are flocking to help. Are you really going to let them have all the glory and reward?"

### Reputation Effects

- **Community Reaction**: Word spreads about the group that refused to help against the Death Curse. This affects how NPCs treat them.
- **Future Opportunities**: Make it clear that refusing this quest closes off certain story paths or alliances.

## Technique 6: Compromise Solutions

### Partial Acceptance

- **Investigation Only**: "I'll fund your investigation in Waterdeep/Faerûn, but if you find evidence the Soulmonger exists, you must go to Chult."
- **Backup Plan**: Agree to be on standby if the first group of adventurers fails.

### Modified Terms

- **Better Payment**: Negotiate higher rewards, but tie them to success.
- **Additional Resources**: Promise powerful magic items, but only obtainable in Chult.
- **Allies**: Provide companions or hirelings who will accompany them.

## Technique 7: Fallback Scenarios

### If Players Remain Unconvinced

- **Alternative Campaign Start**: Have the party get caught up in the curse's effects regardless - they get cursed themselves, or a loved one dies and they seek resurrection that fails.
- **Parallel Story**: Let them pursue their own goals while the Death Curse creates complications that eventually force their involvement.
- **Time Jump**: If they're adamant, fast-forward to a point where the curse has worsened significantly, making their help desperately needed.

## DM Guidelines

### Maintain Player Agency

- Always give players genuine choices
- Make consequences clear but not punitive
- Allow creative solutions to problems

### Know When to Push vs. When to Yield

- If players have legitimate reasons for reluctance, consider adjusting the campaign
- Some groups may not be suited for Tomb of Annihilation's style
- Have backup campaign ideas ready

### Communication is Key

- Discuss player concerns out-of-character
- Be transparent about campaign expectations
- Consider player comfort levels with themes

## Common Player Objections and Responses

### "It's too dangerous"

**Response**: "You're right, Chult is incredibly dangerous. That's why Syndra is offering such generous payment. Most adventurers who go there don't return... but those who do become legends."

### "We have our own quests"

**Response**: Show how the Death Curse affects their personal goals. "The curse is disrupting resurrection magic - how will that affect your plans to bring back your fallen companion?"

### "We don't trust Syndra"

**Response**: Allow investigation but provide evidence of her sincerity. "Your insight suggests she's desperate but genuine. The curse marks on her skin are real."

### "The reward isn't worth the risk"

**Response**: Escalate the stakes. "Syndra offers 10,000 gold now, plus any magic items you want from her collection. But more importantly - if the Soulmonger isn't stopped, everyone dies eventually."
