**Note:** This file includes custom character content (Discordia's tambourine quest) which is DM-created and not from the official source material.

## After Players Accept

Once the party agrees to the quest, Syndra performs the teleportation ritual.

**Location:** Teleportation Platform, Port Nyanzaru Harbor (arrival point)

## What to Say

> "Syndra nods solemnly and begins an arcane ritual. She traces glowing runes in the air, and you feel a strange tugging sensation, as if reality itself is being pulled apart. The world dissolves into swirling colors and sensations...
>
> When the disorientation fades, you find yourselves standing on a stone platform overlooking a bustling harbor. The air is thick and humid, carrying the scent of salt water, exotic spices, and something reptilian. Below you, the port city of Port Nyanzaru teems with life - brightly painted buildings, crowded markets, and... dinosaurs? Massive reptiles pull wagons, race through streets, and lounge in shaded enclosures.
>
> Yet something is wrong.
>
> The familiar faint jangle that usually accompanies Discordia QuickShart is absent. The leather loop on her belt where the triangle tambourine always hangs is empty, its outline still pressed into the worn strap. The strange teleportation left everyone intact… but her beloved triangle tambourine is gone.
>
> The heat hits you like a physical force, and the sounds of the city wash over you: vendors hawking wares in multiple languages, the bellows of strange beasts, and the constant bustle of a thriving metropolis. Welcome to Chult."

## What Players Experience

- The disorienting sensation of teleportation magic
- Arrival on a stone platform overlooking Port Nyanzaru
- Immediate sensory overload: heat, humidity, exotic scents, strange sounds
- The shocking sight of dinosaurs integrated into city life

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Investigate the teleportation circle** - Examine the magical runes and platform (use Arcana checks below)
2. **Notice the missing tambourine** - Discover what was lost in transit (Passive Perception 15, or active check) → *This may become a side quest*: [Side-Quests.md](../04-Side-Quests-and-Activities/Side-Quests.md)
3. **Take in the surroundings** - Observe the harbor, city, and dinosaurs (use Perception checks below)
4. **Resist disorientation** - Make Constitution saves to recover quickly (see Skill Checks below)
5. **Assess the environment** - Use Survival or Nature checks to understand the climate (see Skill Checks below)
6. **Head into the city** → [Harbor-Description.md](../02-Arrival-in-Port-Nyanzaru/Harbor-Description.md) - Move forward to explore Port Nyanzaru

## DM Guidance

This is the transition scene from the familiar to the exotic. Emphasize the sensory overload and culture shock. The missing tambourine is a specific detail that adds flavor - use Passive Perception 15 to notice it automatically, or let players discover it through investigation. Allow skill checks to help players orient themselves. Once they've processed the arrival, transition to the harbor description or city overview.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Notice subtle magical residue from the teleportation

- **Success**: "You notice faint, fading magical runes etched into the stone platform beneath your feet. The teleportation circle Syndra used was exceptionally well-crafted, with additional protective wards woven into the spell. This wasn't a simple transportation - it was designed to protect against the chaotic magical energies that permeate Chult."
- **Failure**: "The magical residue fades too quickly to examine, or the teleportation was so smooth that no visible traces remain."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Not only do you see the runes, but you can identify specific protective enchantments: wards against wild magic surges, temporal stabilization runes to prevent time dilation, and even a subtle soul-anchoring spell to prevent spiritual displacement. The circle is masterwork quality, suggesting Syndra either created it herself or had it made by a very powerful mage."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine the teleportation circle for magical properties

- **Success**: "Upon closer inspection, you can see that the teleportation circle included unusual stabilizing runes. The magic here was specifically designed to counteract the 'wild magic' effects that plague Chult. This suggests Syndra has made this journey before and knows the dangers of teleporting into the peninsula."
- **Failure**: "The circle's magic is too complex or faded to analyze properly. You can tell it's well-made, but the specific properties elude you."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "The investigation reveals the circle is part of a network - there are subtle connection points suggesting this circle links to others, possibly in multiple locations across Faerûn. The stabilizing runes are specifically tuned to Chult's unique magical signature, meaning this circle was built specifically for travel to this peninsula. You also notice a small inscription in Draconic that translates to 'Gateway to Peril' - clearly someone with experience in Chult created this."

### Passive Checks

**Passive Perception 15**: Automatically notice the missing tambourine

- **Success**: "You immediately notice that Discordia's triangle tambourine is missing from her belt. The leather loop where it normally hangs is empty, with only the outline of where it once rested visible on the worn strap."
- **If Passive Perception is below 15**: The player must actively look or be told by another party member who noticed.

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 10 Constitution Save**: Resist teleportation sickness/disorientation

- **Success**: "You shake off the disorientation quickly, feeling fully alert and ready to assess your new surroundings. The teleportation was smooth, and you're ready to act immediately."
- **Failure**: "The teleportation leaves you feeling nauseous and disoriented. You have disadvantage on your first Perception, Investigation, or Insight check made in Port Nyanzaru as you struggle to get your bearings."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "You not only resist the disorientation but actually feel energized by the magical transition. The teleportation seems to have had a positive effect on you. You gain advantage on your first social interaction check (Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation) made in Port Nyanzaru."

**DC 12 Arcana Check**: Understand the teleportation magic being used

- **Success**: "You recognize this as a modified version of the Teleport spell, specifically enhanced with protective wards. The magic feels stable and well-controlled, suggesting Syndra is a skilled spellcaster. The modifications are designed to handle Chult's chaotic magical environment."
- **Failure**: "The teleportation magic is complex and beyond your current understanding. You can tell it's powerful, but the specific mechanics elude you."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "This is an advanced form of Teleportation Circle combined with Plane Shift techniques. Syndra didn't just teleport you - she created a temporary planar bridge that bypassed Chult's natural magical defenses. The spell required significant preparation and likely consumed expensive material components. This level of magical expertise suggests Syndra is far more powerful than she appeared, or she had significant magical assistance."

**DC 13 Survival Check**: Notice environmental changes (temperature, humidity, altitude)

- **Success**: "The environmental shift is dramatic - you've gone from a temperate climate to a tropical one. The temperature has increased significantly, and the humidity is oppressive. You can feel the heat sapping your energy already. The air pressure suggests you're at sea level, and the quality of the air indicates you're near a large body of water."
- **Failure**: "The environment feels different, but you can't pinpoint the specific changes or their implications."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "The environmental analysis is detailed: temperature has increased by approximately 30-40 degrees, humidity is at near-saturation levels, and you're experiencing the full effects of a tropical coastal climate. You immediately recognize that standard adventuring gear from temperate regions will be insufficient - you'll need lighter clothing, more water, and protection from heat exhaustion. The air quality suggests the city is well-ventilated, but the jungle beyond will be far more oppressive."

**DC 11 Nature Check**: Identify the reptilian scents and sounds

- **Success**: "The reptilian scents are complex - you can identify multiple species: large herbivorous dinosaurs (likely sauropods based on the deep, rumbling calls), smaller carnivorous species (the sharp, bird-like chirps), and various reptiles. The mix of scents suggests a thriving ecosystem where dinosaurs are integrated into daily life, not just wild animals."
- **Failure**: "You can tell there are reptiles nearby, but you can't identify the specific species or their significance."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your knowledge of natural history allows you to identify specific species: the deep bellows are from triceratops used as beasts of burden, the higher-pitched calls are from deinonychus (likely used for hunting or racing), and you can even smell the distinct musk of hadrosaurs. The fact that these creatures are so integrated into the city suggests they've been domesticated or at least trained, which is remarkable given their size and power. You also notice the absence of certain predator scents, suggesting the city has effective methods for keeping dangerous dinosaurs at bay."
