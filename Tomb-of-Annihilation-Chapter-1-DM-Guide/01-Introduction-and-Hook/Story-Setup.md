# Story Setup: The Death Curse

*Story overview and Death Curse rules: **p. 5***  
*Adventure summary: **pp. 5-7***  
*Pronunciation: Syndra Silvane (SIN-drah sil-VAYN), Chult (CHULT), Soulmonger (SOUL-mong-er)*

## The Hook

The Death Curse affects the entire world - anyone who was ever resurrected is now slowly withering away, and new resurrection magic fails. The curse is tied to a necromantic artifact called the **Soulmonger**, located in Chult. The party is hired by **Syndra Silvane** *(Dramatis Personae: **p. 4***, *meeting scene: **pp. 7-8**)*, a former adventurer dying from the curse, who offers payment and teleports them to Chult to find and destroy the Soulmonger.

**Location:** Wherever the party begins (tavern, meeting hall, or other starting location)

## What to Say

> "You've heard rumors of a terrible curse spreading across Faerûn - the dead stay dead, and those brought back to life are withering away. Resurrection magic has failed worldwide. A desperate woman named Syndra Silvane approaches your party. She explains that she's dying from this 'Death Curse' and knows its source: a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, hidden in the jungles of Chult.
>
> She offers you 5,000 gold pieces, magic items, and whatever aid she can provide if you'll journey to Chult and destroy this artifact. She has the means to teleport you directly to the port city of Port Nyanzaru, the only safe haven in the dangerous peninsula.
>
> Her voice trembles with urgency and fear. "Please... I don't have much time left. This curse is killing me, and it's dooming so many others. I've tried everything—but you're my only hope now. Will you help me stop this before it's too late? Please, I beg you."

## DM Guidance

This is the campaign's opening hook. Most parties will accept, but allow players to ask questions and make skill checks to feel informed. Use skill checks to reveal information that builds investment in the quest. If players negotiate, be flexible but don't make it too easy - Syndra is desperate but not foolish. Once they accept, transition smoothly to the Syndra meeting scene for more detailed interaction.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe the storyteller or tavern patrons for reactions to the story

- **Success**: "As you tell this tale, you notice several patrons grow unusually quiet. An elderly half-elf at the bar makes a warding gesture against evil, and you catch a merchant at a nearby table quickly concealing a silver holy symbol. The Death Curse is clearly a topic that makes people deeply uncomfortable."
- **Failure**: "The tavern's general noise and activity make it difficult to read individual reactions. People seem to be going about their business normally, though you can't be certain if they're simply ignoring the story or actively avoiding the topic."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "You notice not just the reactions, but specific details: a cleric in the corner has been crying, a group of adventurers at a corner table immediately begin discussing their own experiences with failed resurrections, and you spot a wanted poster for 'information leading to the destruction of the Soulmonger' with a substantial reward listed." *(Note: Specific details like wanted posters are DM-created content to enhance the scene - verify against official source p. 5)*

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Look for physical evidence or corroboration of the story

- **Success**: "Scanning the tavern, you spot a wanted poster on the wall offering a reward for information about 'the Soulmonger artifact.' Additionally, you notice that several patrons bear the withered marks of the Death Curse, though they try to hide them. The story's details about failed resurrections seem to be common knowledge here." *(Note: Specific details like wanted posters are DM-created content to enhance the scene - verify against official source p. 5)*
- **Failure**: "The tavern is cluttered with various notices and decorations, making it hard to distinguish what's relevant. You might have missed something important, or the evidence simply isn't visible from your current position."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "You find multiple pieces of evidence: the wanted poster with contact information, a merchant's ledger showing decreased sales of resurrection scrolls, and overhear a conversation about a recent failed resurrection attempt at the local temple. You also notice a map of Chult with several locations marked, including one labeled 'Soulmonger?'" *(Note: Specific details like wanted posters and maps are DM-created content to enhance the scene - verify against official source p. 5)*

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall historical context about Chult and the Death Curse

- **Success**: "You recall that Chult is a dangerous, unexplored peninsula known for its deadly jungles, dinosaurs, and ancient ruins. The peninsula has been largely avoided by most civilizations due to its hostile environment. The Death Curse began spreading roughly a year ago, and many have speculated it originates from Chult due to the region's reputation for dark magic and necromantic artifacts."
- **Failure**: "Your knowledge of Chult is limited. You know it's a dangerous place, but the specific details about its history and connection to the Death Curse elude you."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "You remember detailed accounts: Chult was once home to powerful necromantic kingdoms, particularly the ancient city of Omu. The peninsula has been the source of several world-threatening magical disasters throughout history. The timing of the Death Curse aligns with increased expedition activity into Chult's interior, suggesting someone or something recently disturbed something that should have remained buried."

**DC 11 Religion Check**: Understand the theological implications of failed resurrection

- **Success**: "The failure of resurrection magic suggests something is fundamentally wrong with the connection between the Material Plane and the realms of the dead. This isn't just a curse affecting individuals - it's disrupting the natural order of death and rebirth that the gods themselves oversee. Such a disruption would require an artifact of immense necromantic power."
- **Failure**: "The theological implications are complex. You understand that resurrection magic shouldn't fail, but the deeper meaning of why this is happening escapes you."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "This goes beyond a simple curse. The Soulmonger must be actively intercepting souls before they can reach their proper afterlife destinations, preventing both resurrection and natural soul passage. This is an offense against multiple deities simultaneously - particularly those who oversee death, life, and the afterlife. The artifact's destruction isn't just a quest, it's a holy imperative."

**DC 12 Insight Check**: Detect if the storyteller is being truthful or holding back information

- **Success**: "The storyteller appears genuine in their concern, but you sense they're holding something back. There's a hesitation when discussing the dangers of Chult, as if they know more about the risks than they're sharing. They seem particularly anxious about the 'Soulmonger' - almost as if they've encountered it before."
- **Failure**: "The storyteller seems sincere, but you can't be certain if they're telling the whole truth or if there are hidden dangers they're not mentioning."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "You detect subtle tells: the storyteller's hands shake slightly when mentioning the Soulmonger, they avoid eye contact when discussing Chult's interior, and there's a distinct fear in their voice that suggests personal experience. They're definitely hiding something about the artifact's true nature or location, possibly to protect you or because they're bound by some agreement."

**DC 13 Arcana Check**: Sense magical disturbances related to the Death Curse

- **Success**: "You can feel a subtle wrongness in the ambient magic around you - like a background hum of necromantic energy that shouldn't be there. The magical weave itself feels slightly corrupted, as if something is drawing power from the fundamental forces that govern life and death. This confirms the story's claims about a powerful artifact affecting magic itself."
- **Failure**: "The ambient magic feels normal to you, though you're aware that more powerful mages have reported disturbances. You can't personally sense the connection to the Death Curse."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "The magical disturbance is more pronounced than you expected. You can actually trace faint threads of necromantic energy in the air, all pointing roughly southward - toward Chult. The corruption in the weave is growing stronger, suggesting the artifact is becoming more active. You also sense that the disturbance affects not just resurrection magic, but all forms of life-restoring magic, including healing spells that bring people back from the brink of death." *(Note: Specific magical details are DM-created content to enhance the scene - verify against official source p. 5)*
