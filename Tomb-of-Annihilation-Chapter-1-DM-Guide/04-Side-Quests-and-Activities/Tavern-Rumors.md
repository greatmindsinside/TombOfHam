# Tavern Rumors in Port Nyanzaru

*Official source: Gathering information: **p. 31***  
*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

**Location:** Tavern (Thundering Lizard or similar), Port Nyanzaru

## What to Say

> "The tavern is alive with conversation. Adventurers share tales of narrow escapes, merchants discuss trade routes and dangers, and locals exchange the latest news and gossip. As you find a table and order drinks, you can't help but overhear snippets of conversation floating through the air.
>
> '...expedition never returned...'
> '...something in the jungle interior is drawing the undead...'
> '...the old city, they say...'
> '...Death Curse is getting worse...'
> '...guide led them straight into a trap...'
>
> Every conversation seems to touch on the jungle, the Death Curse, or the dangers that await those foolish enough to venture beyond the city walls. Information flows freely here, but separating truth from rumor requires careful listening and a discerning ear."

## What Players Find

- Multiple conversations happening simultaneously
- Rumors about failed expeditions and jungle dangers
- Information about the Death Curse and its impact
- Stories about guides, locations, and threats
- Mix of true information, false rumors, and partial truths
- Opportunities to join conversations or overhear details

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Listen passively** - Overhear conversations using Perception checks
2. **Join conversations** - Approach groups and ask questions directly
3. **Buy drinks** - Build rapport with talkative patrons
4. **Use skill checks** - Investigate, persuade, or read information reliability
5. **Follow up on leads** - Pursue interesting rumors or information
6. **Share their own story** - Contribute to conversations and build connections

## DM Guidance

Use rumor tables to provide clues about the Soulmonger and jungle locations. Not all information should be reliable - some rumors may be false or misleading. Dole out information gradually to build mystery and engagement. Players should leave with at least one solid lead pointing into the jungle. Use skill checks to reveal information naturally. Balance information gathering with opportunities for social interaction. Rumors should create excitement about the jungle while establishing that preparation is crucial.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about tavern rumors at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "The tavern is alive with conversation, and as you listen, you realize that every conversation seems to touch on the jungle, the Death Curse, or the dangers that await. Here's what you need to know about the rumors you're hearing:
>
> **First, what rumors are about:** The conversations cover several key topics. Failed expeditions - stories of groups that never returned or came back broken. The Death Curse - how it's spreading and getting stronger. The Soulmonger - rumors about it being in an 'old city' called Omu, or about an oracle ziggurat called Orolunga that might know its location. Jungle dangers - disease, dinosaurs, undead, hostile tribes. And guides - which ones are reliable, which ones to avoid.
>
> **Second, not all rumors are true:** Some information is reliable, some is exaggerated, and some is completely false. Use skill checks to verify rumors - Investigation to cross-reference sources, Insight to detect deception, and History to contextualize information. Don't take everything at face value.
>
> **Third, what you need from rumors:** You need at least one solid lead pointing to a jungle location. This could be information about Omu (the Forbidden City), Orolunga (the oracle), or other destinations. You also need to understand jungle dangers from the horror stories you hear. And you need practical information about guides, supplies, and expedition planning.
>
> **Fourth, how to gather more:** Join conversations, buy drinks to build rapport, use skill checks to verify information, and follow up on interesting leads. The most valuable information often comes from those who've actually been in the jungle - guides, survivors, and experienced adventurers.
>
> **Fifth, the importance of verification:** Trust, but verify. Cross-reference rumors with other sources. Use Investigation to separate truth from fiction. Don't base critical decisions on unverified rumors.
>
> Information flows freely in Port Nyanzaru's taverns, but separating truth from rumor requires careful listening and a discerning ear."

**When to Use This:** If players are overwhelmed by rumors, if they need to understand what information is valuable, or after a very successful Perception check (DC 17+)

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Overhear useful conversations and identify valuable information

- **Success**: "You catch snippets of multiple conversations. You overhear mentions of failed expeditions, jungle dangers, the Death Curse's impact, and various rumors about the Soulmonger's location. You can identify which conversations might contain valuable information worth pursuing."
- **Failure**: "The tavern is noisy and crowded, making it difficult to pick out individual conversations. You hear general chatter but nothing specific."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your hearing is sharp: you can clearly distinguish multiple conversations and identify specific valuable information. You overhear detailed mentions of expedition routes, specific jungle locations, guide reputations, and even rumors about the Soulmonger being in an 'old city' in the interior. You can identify which patrons have the most valuable information and which rumors are worth investigating further."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Verify rumors and separate truth from fiction

- **Success**: "By listening carefully and cross-referencing different conversations, you can identify which rumors seem reliable versus which are likely false or exaggerated. You can separate useful information from mere gossip and identify leads worth pursuing."
- **Failure**: "The rumors are difficult to verify, and you can't determine which information is reliable."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation is thorough: you can cross-reference multiple conversations, identify patterns in the rumors, verify information through different sources, and even detect when the same false rumor is being spread by multiple people (suggesting deliberate misinformation). You can build a comprehensive picture of what's true, what's false, and what needs further investigation."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read the mood and detect when information is being withheld

- **Success**: "You can sense the general mood of the tavern - fear, excitement, desperation, or opportunism. You notice when people are holding back information or when conversations suddenly go quiet. You can identify which patrons might know more than they're sharing."
- **Failure**: "The tavern's mood is difficult to read, and you can't determine if people are withholding information."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is sharp: you can read the emotional landscape of the entire tavern, detect when specific individuals know more than they're sharing, sense hidden agendas or fears, and even identify which patrons might be spreading false information deliberately. You can identify the best people to approach for honest information."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Join conversations and get people to share information

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest help you join conversations. People are willing to share information, especially if you buy drinks or show interest in their stories. You can gather useful rumors and information from multiple sources."
- **Failure**: "People are polite but guarded, sharing only basic information or common knowledge."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your charisma and approach are so effective that people become quite talkative. They share detailed information, introduce you to other sources, and may even reveal information they normally wouldn't share. You might gain valuable leads, contacts, or even invitations to join expeditions or meet important NPCs."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information that helps verify or contextualize rumors

- **Success**: "Your historical knowledge helps you contextualize the rumors you hear. You can identify which stories align with known facts about Chult, which locations are real versus fictional, and which rumors might have a basis in truth."
- **Failure**: "You can't determine if the rumors align with known facts about Chult."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you can verify many rumors against known facts about Chult's history, identify which locations mentioned are real, cross-reference stories with known events, and even identify when rumors are based on actual historical events versus pure fiction. You can build a reliable picture of what's likely true."

## Common Rumors Overheard

### About Failed Expeditions

**Rumor 1**: "Did you hear about the expedition that went to [location]? Only two came back, and they were half-mad. Said something in the jungle is driving people insane."

**Rumor 2**: "Another group disappeared last week. They had a guide, good supplies, everything. Just... gone. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes."

**Rumor 3**: "I heard the Flaming Fist lost an entire patrol. Something's drawing the undead deeper into the jungle, and it's getting worse."

### About the Death Curse

**Rumor 1**: "The Death Curse is spreading. It's not just affecting those who were resurrected - it's getting stronger. Something's feeding it."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard from a priest that the curse is tied to an artifact. Something ancient, something powerful. It's in the jungle somewhere, drawing souls."

**Rumor 3**: "The curse started about a year ago, right when expeditions into the interior increased. Coincidence? I don't think so."

### About the Soulmonger

**Rumor 1**: "They say the source of the curse is in the 'old city' - some ancient place deep in the jungle. No one knows exactly where, but the undead are drawn to it."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard from a guide that there's an ancient ziggurat that might have answers. An oracle, they say. But getting there is nearly impossible."

**Rumor 3**: "The artifact - this Soulmonger - is supposed to be in Omu. The lost city. But no one's been there in centuries, and those who try don't come back."

### About Jungle Dangers

**Rumor 1**: "Disease is everywhere. Mosquitoes, contaminated water, the heat itself. You need protection, or you'll be dead in a week."

**Rumor 2**: "The dinosaurs are the least of your worries. There are things in the jungle that make dinosaurs look tame. Things that shouldn't exist."

**Rumor 3**: "The tribes are getting more hostile. Something's stirring them up. Maybe the curse, maybe something else. But they're not friendly to outsiders anymore."

### About Guides

**Rumor 1**: "Choose your guide carefully. Some will lead you into danger, some will abandon you, and some have their own agendas that don't include your survival."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard [guide name] lost their last three expeditions. But they're cheap, so people keep hiring them. Foolish."

**Rumor 3**: "The best guides are expensive, but worth it. They know the jungle, they know the dangers, and they actually care if you survive."

## Encounter: The Critical Rumor

Use this encounter when players are in a tavern and need to obtain a solid lead about the Soulmonger or jungle locations.

**Location:** Thundering Lizard Tavern (or similar), Port Nyanzaru

### Encounter Setup

Players are in a tavern (Thundering Lizard or similar) when they overhear or participate in a conversation that reveals crucial information about the Death Curse or the Soulmonger's location.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "The tavern is alive with conversation, but one discussion at a nearby table catches your attention. A group of weathered adventurers and a local guide are deep in conversation, their voices low but urgent.
>
> '...and I'm telling you, it's in the old city,' one of them says, leaning forward. 'I've seen the signs - the undead are all moving in that direction. Something's drawing them there, something powerful.'
>
> Another adventurer shakes their head. 'Omu? That's just a legend. No one's been there in centuries. And those who tried...' They trail off, taking a long drink.
>
> The guide speaks up, their voice serious. 'It's not a legend. I've seen it from a distance - the ruins, the ziggurats, the... wrongness of the place. The undead don't just wander there - they're being called. Something in that city is the source of the Death Curse, I'm certain of it.'
>
> The first adventurer nods grimly. 'And it's getting worse. The curse is spreading, getting stronger. Whatever's causing it, it's feeding on souls. We need to find it and destroy it before it's too late.'
>
> They notice you listening and fall silent, eyeing you warily. But the damage - or the information - is already done."

### Encounter Options

1. **Approach the group** - Join the conversation and ask for more details
2. **Listen passively** - Continue eavesdropping using Perception
3. **Buy them drinks** - Build rapport to get more information
4. **Use skill checks** - Investigate, persuade, or verify the information
5. **Take notes** - Remember the information for later investigation
6. **Follow up** - Ask about Omu, the old city, or the Soulmonger

### Encounter Skill Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Overhear the full conversation and catch all details

- **Success**: "You catch the full conversation: the mention of Omu (the 'old city'), the connection to the Soulmonger and Death Curse, the fact that undead are being drawn there, and the urgency of the situation. You have a clear lead pointing to Omu as a potential location for the Soulmonger."
- **Failure**: "The conversation is difficult to follow, and you only catch fragments - mentions of an 'old city' and something about undead, but the details are unclear."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your hearing is sharp: you catch every detail, including specific mentions of Omu, the ziggurats, the way undead are being drawn there, and even hints about the location's approximate direction. You also notice the guide seems to know more than they're sharing, and you can identify them for later questioning."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Verify the rumor and separate truth from speculation

- **Success**: "By cross-referencing what you've heard with other information and asking around, you can verify that Omu is indeed a real location, that undead activity has been increasing in that direction, and that the connection to the Death Curse seems legitimate. This appears to be a reliable lead."
- **Failure**: "The information is difficult to verify, and you can't determine if the rumor is reliable or just speculation."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation is thorough: you can verify Omu's existence and location, confirm the undead activity patterns, cross-reference the information with other sources, and even discover additional details about the old city. You can build a comprehensive understanding of this lead and identify it as highly valuable."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Get the group to share more information

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest help you join the conversation. The adventurers and guide are willing to share more details: rough directions to Omu, warnings about the dangers, and information about what to expect. They may even provide a rough map or additional clues."
- **Failure**: "The group is guarded and doesn't share much beyond what you already overheard."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your approach is so effective that the group becomes quite helpful. They share detailed information about Omu's location, provide warnings about specific dangers, offer contacts or resources, and may even suggest guides who know the area. You gain valuable information and potential allies."

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Detect if the information is reliable or if the speakers are exaggerating

- **Success**: "You can sense the speakers are genuinely concerned and believe what they're saying. The guide seems to have real knowledge, and the adventurers appear to be sharing genuine experiences. The information seems reliable, though some details might be speculation."
- **Failure**: "You can't determine if the speakers are being truthful or if they're exaggerating or speculating."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is sharp: you can detect which parts of the conversation are based on real knowledge (the guide's observations, the undead activity) versus which are speculation (exact details about Omu, the Soulmonger's nature). You can identify the most reliable information and separate it from guesswork."

### Reward

- **Solid Lead** - Information pointing to Omu as a potential Soulmonger location
- **Additional Details** - Warnings, directions, or contacts (if successful checks)
- **Story Progression** - Moves players toward having a destination
- **Potential Contacts** - The guide or adventurers may become allies
