## What to Say

> "The tavern is alive with conversation. Adventurers share tales of narrow escapes, merchants discuss trade routes and dangers, and locals exchange the latest news and gossip. As you find a table and order drinks, you can't help but overhear snippets of conversation floating through the air.
>
> '...expedition never returned...'
> '...something in the jungle interior is drawing the undead...'
> '...the old city, they say...'
> '...Death Curse is getting worse...'
> '...guide led them straight into a trap...'
>
> Every conversation seems to touch on the jungle, the Death Curse, or the dangers that await those foolish enough to venture beyond the city walls. Information flows freely here, but separating truth from rumor requires careful listening and a discerning ear."

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Listen passively** - Overhear conversations using Perception checks
2. **Join conversations** - Approach groups and ask questions directly
3. **Buy drinks** - Build rapport with talkative patrons

## DM Guidance

Use rumor tables to provide clues about the Soulmonger and jungle locations. Not all information should be reliable - some rumors may be false or misleading. Dole out information gradually to build mystery and engagement. Players should leave with at least one solid lead pointing into the jungle. Use skill checks to reveal information naturally. Balance information gathering with opportunities for social interaction. Rumors should create excitement about the jungle while establishing that preparation is crucial.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Overhear useful conversations and identify valuable information

- **Success**: "You catch snippets of multiple conversations. You overhear mentions of failed expeditions, jungle dangers, the Death Curse's impact, and various rumors about the Soulmonger's location. You can identify which conversations might contain valuable information worth pursuing."
- **Failure**: "The tavern is noisy and crowded, making it difficult to pick out individual conversations. You hear general chatter but nothing specific."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your hearing is sharp: you can clearly distinguish multiple conversations and identify specific valuable information. You overhear detailed mentions of expedition routes, specific jungle locations, guide reputations, and even rumors about the Soulmonger being in an 'old city' in the interior. You can identify which patrons have the most valuable information and which rumors are worth investigating further."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Verify rumors and separate truth from fiction

- **Success**: "By listening carefully and cross-referencing different conversations, you can identify which rumors seem reliable versus which are likely false or exaggerated. You can separate useful information from mere gossip and identify leads worth pursuing."
- **Failure**: "The rumors are difficult to verify, and you can't determine which information is reliable."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation is thorough: you can cross-reference multiple conversations, identify patterns in the rumors, verify information through different sources, and even detect when the same false rumor is being spread by multiple people (suggesting deliberate misinformation). You can build a comprehensive picture of what's true, what's false, and what needs further investigation."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read the mood and detect when information is being withheld

- **Success**: "You can sense the general mood of the tavern - fear, excitement, desperation, or opportunism. You notice when people are holding back information or when conversations suddenly go quiet. You can identify which patrons might know more than they're sharing."
- **Failure**: "The tavern's mood is difficult to read, and you can't determine if people are withholding information."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is sharp: you can read the emotional landscape of the entire tavern, detect when specific individuals know more than they're sharing, sense hidden agendas or fears, and even identify which patrons might be spreading false information deliberately. You can identify the best people to approach for honest information."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Join conversations and get people to share information

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest help you join conversations. People are willing to share information, especially if you buy drinks or show interest in their stories. You can gather useful rumors and information from multiple sources."
- **Failure**: "People are polite but guarded, sharing only basic information or common knowledge."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your charisma and approach are so effective that people become quite talkative. They share detailed information, introduce you to other sources, and may even reveal information they normally wouldn't share. You might gain valuable leads, contacts, or even invitations to join expeditions or meet important NPCs."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information that helps verify or contextualize rumors

- **Success**: "Your historical knowledge helps you contextualize the rumors you hear. You can identify which stories align with known facts about Chult, which locations are real versus fictional, and which rumors might have a basis in truth."
- **Failure**: "You can't determine if the rumors align with known facts about Chult."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you can verify many rumors against known facts about Chult's history, identify which locations mentioned are real, cross-reference stories with known events, and even identify when rumors are based on actual historical events versus pure fiction. You can build a reliable picture of what's likely true."

## Common Rumors Overheard

### About Failed Expeditions

**Rumor 1**: "Did you hear about the expedition that went to [location]? Only two came back, and they were half-mad. Said something in the jungle is driving people insane."

**Rumor 2**: "Another group disappeared last week. They had a guide, good supplies, everything. Just... gone. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes."

**Rumor 3**: "I heard the Flaming Fist lost an entire patrol. Something's drawing the undead deeper into the jungle, and it's getting worse."

### About the Death Curse

**Rumor 1**: "The Death Curse is spreading. It's not just affecting those who were resurrected - it's getting stronger. Something's feeding it."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard from a priest that the curse is tied to an artifact. Something ancient, something powerful. It's in the jungle somewhere, drawing souls."

**Rumor 3**: "The curse started about a year ago, right when expeditions into the interior increased. Coincidence? I don't think so."

### About the Soulmonger

**Rumor 1**: "They say the source of the curse is in the 'old city' - some ancient place deep in the jungle. No one knows exactly where, but the undead are drawn to it."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard from a guide that there's an ancient ziggurat that might have answers. An oracle, they say. But getting there is nearly impossible."

**Rumor 3**: "The artifact - this Soulmonger - is supposed to be in Omu. The lost city. But no one's been there in centuries, and those who try don't come back."

### About Jungle Dangers

**Rumor 1**: "Disease is everywhere. Mosquitoes, contaminated water, the heat itself. You need protection, or you'll be dead in a week."

**Rumor 2**: "The dinosaurs are the least of your worries. There are things in the jungle that make dinosaurs look tame. Things that shouldn't exist."

**Rumor 3**: "The tribes are getting more hostile. Something's stirring them up. Maybe the curse, maybe something else. But they're not friendly to outsiders anymore."

### About Guides

**Rumor 1**: "Choose your guide carefully. Some will lead you into danger, some will abandon you, and some have their own agendas that don't include your survival."

**Rumor 2**: "I heard [guide name] lost their last three expeditions. But they're cheap, so people keep hiring them. Foolish."

**Rumor 3**: "The best guides are expensive, but worth it. They know the jungle, they know the dangers, and they actually care if you survive."
