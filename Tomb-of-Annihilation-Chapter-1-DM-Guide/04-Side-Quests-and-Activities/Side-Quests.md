## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city of opportunity, and not all of them involve the jungle. As you explore, you'll encounter people with problems that need solving, jobs that need doing, and conflicts that need resolution. These side quests might seem like distractions from your main goal, but they can provide valuable experience, connections, and resources that will help you in your journey to find the Soulmonger.
>
> Some quests will come to you - a desperate merchant, a worried priest, a concerned citizen. Others you'll need to seek out by asking the right questions or being in the right place at the right time. Each quest is a chance to learn more about the city, its people, and the dangers that await you in the jungle beyond."

## What Players Encounter

- Quest givers approaching them directly (merchants, priests, citizens)
- Opportunities that require seeking out (asking questions, being in right place)
- Various quest types: debt collection, escort missions, pirate hunts, missing persons, beast control
- Rewards: gold, information, faction favor, equipment
- Connections to the larger Chult plot

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Accept a quest** - Take on a side mission for rewards and connections
2. **Investigate quest details** - Use skill checks to learn more before committing
3. **Negotiate terms** - Try to get better rewards or more information
4. **Choose which quests to pursue** - Prioritize based on rewards, connections, or interest
5. **Decline quests** - Focus on main quest preparation instead
6. **Complete multiple quests** - Take on 1-2 side quests before leaving the city

## DM Guidance

Present 1-2 side quests per session to avoid overwhelming players. Keep quests short (1-2 encounters each) so they don't derail the main story. Use side quests to introduce factions, locations, or NPCs that may become important later. Connect quests to the larger Chult plot when possible. Not all quests are required - let players choose which to pursue. Use quests to provide XP, flavor, and world-building. Use side quests to introduce factions or locations. They should provide clues about jungle dangers. Not required for chapter completion, but enrich the experience.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Notice quest opportunities or people in need

- **Success**: "You notice individuals who seem distressed, conversations about problems that need solving, or signs of trouble that might lead to quest opportunities. You can identify potential quest givers and understand what kind of help they might need."
- **Failure**: "The city is busy, and you miss potential quest opportunities or don't notice people who might need help."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you can identify multiple quest opportunities, understand the nature of each problem, spot connections between different quests, and even detect which quests might be more valuable or dangerous. You can prioritize which quests to pursue."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research quest details and gather information

- **Success**: "By asking questions and investigating, you can learn more about the quest: what's really going on, who's involved, what the risks are, and what the rewards might be. You can identify potential complications or hidden agendas."
- **Failure**: "The quest details are unclear, and you can't determine the full scope of what you're getting into."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals comprehensive information: you understand the full context of the quest, identify all parties involved, discover hidden complications or agendas, and even find ways to complete the quest more efficiently or gain additional rewards. You might uncover connections to your main quest or valuable information about Chult."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Evaluate quest givers and their motivations

- **Success**: "You can read the quest givers' true motivations. Some are genuinely in need, while others might have hidden agendas or be trying to use you. You can identify which quests are legitimate and which might be traps or scams."
- **Failure**: "The quest givers seem sincere, but you can't be certain of their true motivations."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific motivations (greed, desperation, revenge, manipulation), identify hidden agendas, sense when quest givers are lying or holding back information, and even predict how they'll react to different outcomes. You can negotiate better terms or avoid dangerous situations."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Negotiate better rewards or terms

- **Success**: "Your negotiation skills help you get better rewards, more favorable terms, or additional information. Quest givers are more willing to offer bonuses or provide helpful resources."
- **Failure**: "The quest givers stick to their original offers and aren't willing to negotiate."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your negotiation is highly effective: you can secure significantly better rewards, gain additional benefits (like equipment, information, or future favors), and even convince quest givers to provide upfront payments or resources. Some might offer to become ongoing allies or contacts."

**DC 10 History Check**: Recall information about quest-related locations or people

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about the locations, people, or situations involved in the quest. This knowledge helps you understand the context and potential complications."
- **Failure**: "The quest details don't ring any bells, and you're going in without prior knowledge."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you recall detailed information about the locations, people, and situations involved. You know about past events, relationships, and potential complications. This knowledge might help you complete the quest more effectively or avoid dangers."
