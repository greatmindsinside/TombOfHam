## Overview

Before leaving Port Nyanzaru, players need at least one solid lead pointing to a jungle location. This gives them a destination and purpose for their expedition.

## What Constitutes a Solid Lead

A solid lead is any information that points to a specific location or direction in the jungle:

- **Rumors** about lost cities, ruins, or locations of interest
- **Clues** about the Soulmonger's location
- **Information** about specific jungle destinations (Omu, Orolunga, Nangalore, etc.)
- **Directions** from NPCs who know the jungle
- **Maps** or references to specific locations
- **Stories** that mention specific places

## Minimum Requirement

**At least one** of the following:

1. A rumor pointing to a jungle location
2. A clue about where to search for the Soulmonger
3. Information about a specific destination
4. A direction or lead from an NPC

## How Players Can Obtain Leads

### Primary Sources

- **[Gathering Information](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Gathering-Information.md)** - Main method for obtaining rumors and clues
- **[Meeting Volo](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Meeting-Volo.md)** - Volo often has information about jungle locations
- **[Tavern Rumors](../04-Side-Quests-and-Activities/Tavern-Rumors.md)** - Rumors heard in taverns
- **[Key NPCs](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Key-NPCs.md)** - Information from important NPCs
- **[Faction Representatives](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Power-Structure.md)** - Leads from faction contacts

### Skill Checks

- **Investigation (DC 12-15)**: Actively search for information
- **Persuasion (DC 10-13)**: Convince NPCs to share information
- **Insight (DC 11-14)**: Detect when NPCs are holding back information

## Common Leads Players Might Find

### High-Value Leads

- **Omu** - The Forbidden City, rumored location of the Soulmonger
- **Orolunga** - The oracle ziggurat that might know the Soulmonger's location
- **Nangalore** - Ruined garden with potential clues
- **Fort Beluarian** - Flaming Fist stronghold with information
- **Camp Vengeance** - Order of the Gauntlet outpost

### Medium-Value Leads

- **Kir Sabal** - Aarakocra village in the mountains
- **Aldani Basin** - Swamp region with ruins
- **Various ruins** - Scattered locations throughout Chult

### Low-Value Leads (Still Valid)

- General directions ("head south")
- Vague locations ("somewhere in the jungle interior")
- Second-hand rumors that need verification

## DM Guidance

### Ensuring Players Get Leads

If players haven't obtained a lead:

1. **Make information more available** - Have NPCs volunteer information
2. **Lower skill check DCs** - Make it easier to gather information
3. **Provide obvious leads** - Have Volo or another NPC give clear directions
4. **Use rumors** - Drop hints in tavern conversations
5. **Guide suggestions** - Have guides mention destinations they know

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about solid leads at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Before you can leave Port Nyanzaru, you need to know where you're going. Here's what you need to understand about solid leads:
>
> **First, what a solid lead is:** A solid lead is at least one rumor or clue pointing to a specific jungle location. This could be information about Omu (the Forbidden City where the Soulmonger is said to be), Orolunga (the oracle ziggurat that might know the Soulmonger's location), Nangalore (a ruined garden with potential clues), or another destination. Without a lead, you'd be wandering aimlessly into the jungle.
>
> **Second, where to get leads:** You can obtain leads from multiple sources. Volo has extensive knowledge about jungle locations. Tavern rumors often mention destinations. Faction representatives may have information about their outposts. Guides can suggest destinations they know. Information brokers sell leads for a price. And NPCs throughout the city share stories and rumors.
>
> **Third, what makes a lead solid:** A solid lead gives you a specific location or clear direction. It doesn't need to be perfectly accurate, but it should point you toward a real destination. High-value leads (like Omu or Orolunga) are specific and well-known. Medium-value leads (like Nangalore or Fort Beluarian) are still valid destinations. Even vague leads (like 'head south' or 'somewhere in the interior') can work if they give you direction.
>
> **Fourth, verifying leads:** Not all information is reliable. Use skill checks to verify leads - Investigation to cross-reference sources, Insight to detect deception, and History to contextualize information. Trust, but verify. A lead doesn't need to be 100% accurate, but you should have some confidence in it.
>
> **Fifth, you need at least one:** You cannot leave Port Nyanzaru without at least one lead. The jungle is vast, and without a destination, you'll get lost and waste time. Gather information, ask questions, and find a direction before departing.
>
> Without a solid lead, you're not ready to leave. Gather information, find a destination, and then you can venture into the jungle with purpose.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but lack a lead, if they don't understand what constitutes a solid lead, or when doing a final readiness check

---

### Verifying Leads

Before allowing departure, confirm:

- [ ] Players have at least one lead pointing to a jungle location
- [ ] The lead is specific enough to give them a direction
- [ ] Players understand what the lead means
- [ ] Players have a general idea of where to go

### If Players Have No Leads

**Don't let them leave without a lead.** Provide opportunities:

1. Direct them to [Gathering Information](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Gathering-Information.md)
2. Have an NPC approach with information
3. Make a rumor more obvious in a tavern
4. Have their guide suggest a destination

## Examples of Solid Leads

### Example 1: Rumor from Tavern

> "I heard from a trader that there's a lost city called Omu somewhere in the jungle interior. They say it's full of treasure and danger. The trader mentioned it's somewhere south of the Aldani Basin."

### Example 2: Information from Volo

> "Volo tells you about an oracle ziggurat called Orolunga. He says it's ancient and powerful, and might know where the Soulmonger is hidden. He gives you rough directions: 'Head inland, follow the river, and look for the mountain with the stone steps.'"

### Example 3: Clue from Guide

> "Your guide, Eku, mentions she knows of several locations that might be relevant to your quest. She suggests starting with Omu, which she describes as 'a city of death and secrets' that might hold answers about the Death Curse."

## What to Say When Players Have a Lead

> "You've gathered information pointing to [location]. You have a sense of direction and purpose. While the exact path might be unclear, you know where you're heading and why. This gives you confidence that you're not wandering blindly into the jungle."

## What to Say When Players Lack a Lead

> "As you prepare to leave Port Nyanzaru, you realize you don't have a clear destination. The jungle is vast, and without a lead or direction, you'd be wandering aimlessly. You should gather more information before departing - talk to locals, visit taverns, or seek out those who know the jungle."

## Encounters to Obtain Leads

Use these encounters when players need to obtain a solid lead before leaving Port Nyanzaru.

### Encounter 1: The Talkative Trader

**Setup:** Players encounter a trader in the Grand Souk or a tavern who's just returned from the jungle.

**What to Say:**

> "A weathered trader with sun-browned skin and a missing finger approaches your table. 'You're planning to head into the jungle, aren't you? I can see it in your eyes - that mix of excitement and fear. I just got back from a trading expedition, and let me tell you, I saw something interesting. There's a lost city out there - they call it Omu. Ancient, dangerous, full of secrets. I didn't go near it myself, but I met someone who did. Said it's somewhere south of the Aldani Basin, in the jungle interior. If you're looking for something powerful, something that might be connected to this Death Curse everyone's talking about... that's where I'd start looking.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 10)**: Get more details about Omu's location

### Encounter 2: Volo's Information

**Setup:** Players seek out Volo or he approaches them with information.

**What to Say:**

> "Volo's eyes light up when he sees you. 'Ah, adventurers! Perfect timing. I've been researching Chult's ancient sites, and I've discovered something fascinating. There's an oracle ziggurat called Orolunga - ancient, powerful, said to answer any question if you can reach it. It's located inland, following the river that flows from the mountains. The locals say it's guarded by something... or someone. If you're looking for answers about the Soulmonger, Orolunga might know. I can give you rough directions if you're interested.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 12)**: Get detailed directions to Orolunga
- **Investigation (DC 13)**: Learn about Orolunga's history and what to expect
- **History (DC 14)**: Recall legends about Orolunga

### Encounter 3: Guide's Suggestion

**Setup:** If players have hired a guide, the guide offers destination suggestions.

**What to Say:**

> "Your guide, [guide name], pulls you aside. 'Before we leave, we should decide where we're going. I know several places that might be relevant to your quest. There's Omu - the Forbidden City. Dangerous, but if you're looking for the source of the Death Curse, that's where many believe it is. Or there's Nangalore - a ruined garden complex. Less dangerous, but might have clues. Or we could head to Fort Beluarian - the Flaming Fist might have information. Where do you want to start?'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 10)**: Get the guide to recommend the best destination
- **Investigation (DC 12)**: Learn details about each suggested location
- **Insight (DC 11)**: Determine which destination the guide knows best

**Reward:** Multiple lead options (guide's choice)

**What to Say:**

> "A group of locals at a nearby table are sharing stories. One, a grizzled old sailor, says: 'I heard from a merchant that there's something strange happening in the jungle interior. Undead are more active, and there's talk of a lost city called Omu. The merchant said it's somewhere deep in the jungle, past the Aldani Basin. Said it's full of traps and treasure, but also death. If you're brave enough - or foolish enough - that's where I'd look for answers about this Death Curse.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Perception (DC 10)**: Overhear the full conversation
- **Persuasion (DC 11)**: Join the conversation and get more details
- **Investigation (DC 12)**: Verify the rumor and learn more

### Encounter 5: Faction Contact

**Setup:** Players interact with a faction representative who has information.

**What to Say:**

> "A representative from [faction] approaches you. 'We've been tracking the Death Curse, and we believe we know where to start looking. Our scouts have identified several locations of interest. There's Camp Vengeance - our outpost in the jungle. They might have information. Or there's Orolunga - an ancient oracle that could answer your questions. We can provide directions to either location if you're willing to share what you learn with us.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 12)**: Get information without committing to sharing
- **Investigation (DC 13)**: Learn about both locations in detail
- **Insight (DC 11)**: Determine the faction's true motives

**Reward:** Lead to Camp Vengeance or Orolunga (faction-dependent)

---

### Encounter 6: The Desperate Survivor

**Setup:** Players encounter a survivor from a failed expedition.

**What to Say:**

> "A gaunt, feverish-looking person stumbles toward you. 'You're going into the jungle, aren't you? Listen to me - I was part of an expedition. We were looking for... something. We found ruins, but most of us didn't make it back. I remember... there was a place. Nangalore, they called it. A ruined garden. Beautiful, but deadly. If you're looking for answers, that might be a place to start. But be careful - the jungle doesn't forgive mistakes.'"

I know about several locations that might interest you. Omu, the Forbidden City. Orolunga, the oracle. Nangalore, the ruined garden. I can give you directions to any of them... for the right price.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 12)**: Negotiate a better price
- **Investigation (DC 13)**: Verify the merchant's information is accurate

- **If time is short**: Use the most direct encounter (Guide's Suggestion or Volo)
