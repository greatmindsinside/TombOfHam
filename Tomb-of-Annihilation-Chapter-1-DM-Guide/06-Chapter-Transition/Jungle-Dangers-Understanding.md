## Overview

Before leaving Port Nyanzaru, players should understand the dangers that await them in the jungle. This knowledge helps them prepare appropriately and sets expectations for the challenges ahead.

## Essential Knowledge

Players should be aware of these key dangers:

### 1. Disease

- **Malaria** from mosquitoes
- **Dysentery** from contaminated water
- **Infection** from wounds
- **Daily saves** required when exposed
- **Prevention**: Insect repellent, clean water, proper hygiene

### 2. Weather and Environment

- **Extreme heat** causing exhaustion
- **Tropical storms** disrupting travel
- **Humidity** making conditions miserable
- **Daily weather checks** affecting travel

### 3. Navigation Challenges

- **Getting lost** without a guide
- **Difficult terrain** slowing progress
- **No clear paths** through dense jungle
- **Guide essential** for safe navigation

### 4. Random Encounters

- **Dangerous creatures** (dinosaurs, undead, predators)
- **Hostile tribes** (Batiri goblins, etc.)
- **Natural hazards** (quicksand, falling trees, floods)
- **Daily encounter rolls** in the wilderness

### 5. Resource Management

- **Water scarcity** - Need 1 gallon per person per day
- **Food requirements** - Need 1 ration per person per day
- **Supply limits** - Can't carry unlimited resources
- **Running out** leads to exhaustion and death

### 6. Exhaustion

- **Multiple causes**: Heat, forced march, disease, lack of resources
- **Cumulative effects**: Gets worse with each level
- **Can be fatal**: Level 6 exhaustion = death
- **Recovery difficult** in jungle conditions

## How Players Learn About Dangers

### Information Sources

- **[Hiring Guides](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Hiring-Guides.md)** - Guides explain dangers
- **[Supplies and Gear](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Supplies-and-Gear.md)** - Merchants warn about needs
- **[Tavern Rumors](../04-Side-Quests-and-Activities/Tavern-Rumors.md)** - Stories of failed expeditions
- **[Key NPCs](../03-City-Exploration-and-Social-Play/Key-NPCs.md)** - Warnings from experienced NPCs

### Skill Checks

- **Investigation (DC 12)**: Research jungle dangers
- **Survival (DC 11)**: Understand survival challenges
- **Insight (DC 10)**: Sense the seriousness of warnings

## What to Tell Players

### Basic Warnings

> "Everyone in Port Nyanzaru has stories about the jungle. They speak of disease that strikes without warning, weather that can kill, creatures that hunt in the darkness, and explorers who simply... disappear. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Those who venture unprepared rarely return."

### Specific Dangers

**Disease:**
> "Mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. Contaminated water can kill you in days. Every wound risks infection. Without proper protection, you'll be making daily saves against disease - and failure means suffering, weakness, and potentially death."

**Weather:**
> "The heat alone can kill you. Storms can destroy your supplies. You'll need shelter, water storage, and protection from the elements. The weather changes daily, and you must be prepared for anything."

**Navigation:**
> "The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. A guide isn't optional - it's essential for survival."

**Encounters:**
> "Every day in the jungle brings new dangers. Dinosaurs hunt in the undergrowth. Undead wander from the Soulmonger's influence. Hostile tribes defend their territory. Natural hazards can kill the unwary. You must be ready for combat, negotiation, or flight at any moment."

**Resources:**
> "You can't carry everything. Water is heavy but essential. Food spoils. Supplies run out. When you run out of water or food, exhaustion sets in quickly. Plan carefully, ration wisely, and always know where your next meal and drink are coming from."

## Minimum Understanding Required

Before leaving, players should know:

- [ ] The jungle is extremely dangerous
- [ ] Disease is a constant threat
- [ ] Weather can be deadly
- [ ] Getting lost is easy without a guide
- [ ] Random encounters are common
- [ ] Resources are limited and must be managed
- [ ] Exhaustion can kill

## DM Guidance

### Ensuring Understanding

If players don't seem to understand the dangers:

1. **Have NPCs emphasize warnings** - Make dangers clear through dialogue
2. **Share horror stories** - Tell tales of failed expeditions
3. **Show consequences** - Describe sick or exhausted NPCs
4. **Use skill checks** - Let players learn through Investigation/Survival checks
5. **Guide explanations** - Have guides explain what they'll face

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about jungle dangers at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Before you leave Port Nyanzaru, you need to understand what you're facing. The jungle will try to kill you every single day. Here's what you absolutely must know:
>
> **First, disease:** Mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. Contaminated water can kill you in days. Every wound risks infection. Without insect repellent and clean water sources, you'll be making daily saves against disease. Disease kills more adventurers than creatures do. This is the biggest threat you'll face.
>
> **Second, weather:** Extreme heat causes exhaustion in hours. Tropical storms can destroy your supplies and gear. You need proper shelter, water storage that won't break, and protection from the elements. The weather changes daily, and you must be prepared for anything. Weather can kill you just as easily as creatures.
>
> **Third, navigation:** The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. A guide isn't optional - it's essential for survival. Even experienced adventurers can get lost and die without proper guidance.
>
> **Fourth, random encounters:** Every day in the jungle brings new dangers. Dinosaurs hunt in the undergrowth. Undead wander from the Soulmonger's influence. Hostile tribes defend their territory. Natural hazards (quicksand, falling trees, floods) can kill the unwary. You must be ready for combat, negotiation, or flight at any moment.
>
> **Fifth, resource management:** You can't carry everything. Water is heavy but essential - you need a gallon per person per day, minimum. Food spoils faster in the jungle. Supplies run out. When you run out of water or food, exhaustion sets in quickly. Plan carefully, ration wisely, and always know where your next meal and drink are coming from.
>
> **Sixth, exhaustion:** Exhaustion is cumulative and can be fatal. Heat, forced march, disease, lack of resources - all cause exhaustion. Level 6 exhaustion means death. Recovery is difficult in jungle conditions. Manage your resources and pace yourself, or exhaustion will kill you.
>
> The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Those who venture unprepared rarely return. Understand these dangers, prepare for them, and then you can face what awaits.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but don't understand the dangers, if they're dismissive of warnings, or when doing a final readiness check

### Verifying Understanding

Before allowing departure, confirm:

- [ ] Players have heard warnings about jungle dangers
- [ ] Players understand disease is a threat
- [ ] Players know weather can be dangerous
- [ ] Players understand the importance of a guide
- [ ] Players know about resource management
- [ ] Players understand exhaustion risks

### If Players Don't Understand

**Don't let them leave without understanding.** Provide opportunities:

1. Have an NPC give explicit warnings
2. Show them examples of unprepared explorers
3. Use skill checks to reveal information
4. Have their guide explain dangers
5. Share specific horror stories

## Examples of Warnings

### From a Guide

> "The jungle will test you every day. Disease, weather, creatures, getting lost - these aren't possibilities, they're certainties. I've seen strong adventurers die from a single mosquito bite. I've seen parties starve because they didn't plan for getting lost. The jungle doesn't care how powerful you are - it kills the unprepared."

### From a Merchant

> "You think you have enough supplies? You don't. The jungle will use more water than you expect. Food will spoil faster. You'll lose gear. You'll waste days getting lost. Buy more than you think you need, because you'll need more than you think."

### From a Survivor

> "I was part of an expedition last year. Twelve of us went into the jungle. Three of us came back. Disease took four. Creatures killed three. Two died of exhaustion. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Prepare for everything, because everything will try to kill you."

## What to Say When Players Understand

> "You've heard the warnings, seen the consequences, and understand what awaits you. The jungle is deadly, but you're prepared for the challenges. You know what to expect, and you've taken steps to mitigate the dangers. You're ready to face what comes."

## What to Say When Players Don't Understand

> "As you prepare to leave, you realize you don't fully understand what you're facing. The warnings you've heard seem vague, and you're not certain what the real dangers are. You should seek more information - talk to guides, listen to survivors' stories, or research the challenges ahead before venturing into the unknown."

## Encounters to Learn About Dangers

Use these encounters when players need to understand jungle dangers before leaving Port Nyanzaru.

### Encounter 1: The Wounded Guide

**Setup:** Players encounter a guide who recently returned from the jungle, showing signs of disease and exhaustion.

**What to Say:**

> "You notice a guide sitting in a corner of the tavern, looking pale and weak. One of their arms is bandaged, and they're shivering despite the heat. When you approach, they look up with fever-bright eyes. 'You're planning to go into the jungle, aren't you? Look at me - this is what the jungle does. I got bit by a mosquito three days ago, and now I'm fighting off disease. My last expedition lost two people to disease, one to exhaustion, and one to a creature attack. The jungle doesn't care how strong you are - it kills the unprepared. Make sure you have insect repellent, clean water, and a guide who knows what they're doing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me... or worse.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Medicine (DC 12)**: Help the guide and learn specific disease information

I've supplied dozens of expeditions, and most of them underestimate what they need. Water? You'll need a gallon per person per day, minimum. More in extreme heat. Food? It spoils faster in the jungle. You'll lose supplies. You'll get lost and waste days. Buy twice what you think you need, because the jungle will take more than you expect. And don't forget insect repellent - disease is the biggest killer out there.'"

- **Investigation (DC 12)**: Learn about supply management challenges

Four died from disease - mosquitoes, contaminated water, infected wounds. Three were killed by creatures - dinosaurs, undead, things I can't describe. Two died of exhaustion - we got lost, ran out of supplies, and they just... gave up. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Every day brings new dangers. Disease, weather, creatures, getting lost - these aren't possibilities, they're certainties. Prepare for everything, because everything will try to kill you.'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Persuasion (DC 11)**: Get more specific details about what went wrong

Disease from mosquitoes and contaminated water - you'll need insect repellent and clean water sources. Weather that can kill - extreme heat causes exhaustion, storms destroy supplies. Navigation is impossible without a guide - you'll get lost and waste days. Random encounters are constant - dinosaurs, undead, hostile tribes, natural hazards. And resources are limited - you can't carry everything, and running out means death. This isn't a walk in the woods. This is survival. Are you ready?'"

**Skill Checks:**

- **Investigation (DC 12)**: Ask detailed questions and get comprehensive answers

Got bit by a mosquito, and now they're fighting for their life. The healers say if they don't recover soon, they'll die. This is what the jungle does - one mistake, one moment of carelessness, and disease takes hold. Without proper protection, you'll be making daily saves against disease. And failure means suffering, weakness, and potentially death.'"

Wasted a week trying to find their way. Ran out of supplies. Two of them died of exhaustion before they found their way back. The jungle has no roads, no clear paths.
