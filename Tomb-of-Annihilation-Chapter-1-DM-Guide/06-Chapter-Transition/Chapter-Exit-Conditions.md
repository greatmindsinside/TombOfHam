## What to Say

You've hired a guide, stocked up on supplies, and learned about the dangers that await you in the jungle. The city has been your safe haven, but now it's time to leave civilization behind and venture into the untamed wilderness of Chult.
>
> As you make your final preparations, you can't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. The jungle looms beyond the city walls - a vast, green expanse that has claimed the lives of countless explorers. But you have a mission, and you're as ready as you'll ever be. The time has come to find the Soulmonger and put an end to the Death Curse."

## DM Guidance

Before allowing departure, verify players have essential elements: guide, supplies, and at least one lead. If missing essential elements, provide opportunities to acquire them. Don't let players leave unprepared - the jungle is deadly. Use this phase to ensure readiness and build anticipation. Once all essentials are met, transition smoothly to leaving the city. This marks the end of Chapter 1 and the beginning of wilderness exploration.
