*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

**Location:** Port Nyanzaru (General - before departure)

## What to Say

> "You've spent time in Port Nyanzaru, gathering information, making connections, and preparing for the journey ahead. You've hired a guide, stocked up on supplies, and learned about the dangers that await you in the jungle. The city has been your safe haven, but now it's time to leave civilization behind and venture into the untamed wilderness of Chult.
>
> As you make your final preparations, you can't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. The jungle looms beyond the city walls - a vast, green expanse that has claimed the lives of countless explorers. But you have a mission, and you're as ready as you'll ever be. The time has come to find the Soulmonger and put an end to the Death Curse."

## What Players Should Have

- **Solid Lead**: At least one rumor or clue pointing to a jungle location → [Solid Lead Requirements](./Solid-Lead-Requirements.md)
- **Guide Hired**: A guide to lead them through the wilderness → [Hiring Guides](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Hiring-Guides.md)
- **Proper Supplies**: Basic expedition gear (food, water, insect repellent) → [Supplies and Gear](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Supplies-and-Gear.md)
- **Understanding**: Knowledge that danger awaits outside the city walls → [Jungle Dangers Understanding](./Jungle-Dangers-Understanding.md)
- **Optional**: Charter, faction contacts, side quest completion, chosen destination → [Optional Preparations](./Optional-Preparations.md)

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Verify readiness** - Use skill checks to ensure all essential elements are in place
2. **Final preparations** - Make any last-minute purchases or arrangements
3. **Gather missing elements** - If something is missing, seek it out before departing
4. **Choose destination** - Select a specific jungle location to head toward
5. **Say farewells** - Make final connections or goodbyes in the city
6. **Begin the journey** - Depart Port Nyanzaru and enter the jungle

## DM Guidance

Before allowing departure, verify players have essential elements: guide, supplies, and at least one lead. If missing essential elements, provide opportunities to acquire them. Don't let players leave unprepared - the jungle is deadly. Use this phase to ensure readiness and build anticipation. Once all essentials are met, transition smoothly to leaving the city. This marks the end of Chapter 1 and the beginning of wilderness exploration.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about exit requirements at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "As you prepare to leave Port Nyanzaru, let me make sure you understand what you absolutely must have before venturing into the jungle:
>
> **First, a solid lead:** You need at least one rumor or clue pointing to a jungle location. This could be information about Omu (the Forbidden City where the Soulmonger is said to be), Orolunga (the oracle ziggurat that might know the Soulmonger's location), or another destination. Without a destination, you'd be wandering aimlessly into the jungle. You can get leads from Volo, tavern rumors, faction representatives, guides, or other information sources.
>
> **Second, a guide:** A guide is absolutely essential - not optional. The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. Guides provide navigation, survival skills, and local knowledge. You can hire guides through Merchant Prince Kwayothe, guide recruiters, or the guide guild. This is one of the most important decisions you'll make.
>
> **Third, proper supplies:** You need basic expedition gear: food rations (one per person per day, minimum one week), water containers (one gallon per person per day), insect repellent (absolutely essential - disease kills), tents for shelter, and rain catchers for water collection. Missing any of these could mean death. You can buy supplies in the Grand Souk.
>
> **Fourth, understanding of dangers:** You need to know that the jungle is extremely dangerous. Disease from mosquitoes and contaminated water, weather that can kill, navigation challenges, constant random encounters, limited resources, and exhaustion that can kill. Understanding these dangers helps you prepare properly. You can learn about dangers from guides, merchants, survivors' stories, or information sources.
>
> **Optional but recommended:** An expedition charter from the Flaming Fist provides legal protection. Faction contacts can provide resources and information. Completing side quests provides experience and connections. Choosing a specific destination helps with planning.
>
> The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Those who venture unprepared rarely return. Make sure you have the essentials before leaving.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but you need to verify they understand all requirements, if they're missing essential elements, or when doing a final readiness check

## Skill Checks

Use these skill checks to help players assess their readiness and to guide what information you provide. The results tell you what to say to help players understand what they need before leaving Port Nyanzaru.

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Check for essential supplies

**What to Say:**

- **Success (12-16)**: "As you do a final check of your gear, you can confirm you have the essential supplies: food rations, water containers, insect repellent, and basic expedition equipment. [If missing items, tell them specifically what's missing]. You feel confident about your material preparation."
- **Failure (Below 12)**: "You've gathered quite a bit of gear, but you're not entirely certain if you have everything you need. Something feels like it might be missing, but you can't put your finger on what. You might want to double-check your supplies or consult with someone more experienced."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your careful observation reveals everything: you have all essential supplies - food, water, insect repellent, and proper gear. You notice [list any missing items if applicable, or say 'no gaps in your preparation']. You even spot a few last-minute items that could be useful: [suggest 1-2 optional items like rain catchers or extra rope]. You're confident you're fully prepared."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Verify overall readiness and identify gaps

**What to Say:**

- **Success (13-17)**: "After reviewing your supplies, information gathered, and preparations, you can confirm you have the essentials: [guide name] as your guide, supplies for the journey, and at least one lead pointing to [destination or 'a jungle location']. [If missing something essential, state it clearly: 'However, you realize you still need [missing element] before you can safely depart.']"
- **Failure (Below 13)**: "Your preparations seem adequate - you have supplies, you've hired a guide, and you've gathered information. But you can't shake the feeling that something important might be missing. You're not entirely certain if you're truly ready."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your thorough review confirms everything: you have [guide name] as your guide, all essential supplies, and clear leads pointing to [destination]. You've identified any gaps and addressed them. You even notice opportunities to improve your readiness: [suggest 1-2 optional improvements like getting a charter or making faction contacts]. You're as prepared as you can be for the journey ahead."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Survival Check**: Assess jungle travel readiness

**What to Say:**

- **Success (11-15)**: "Your survival knowledge tells you that for jungle travel, you need: a capable guide (you have [guide name]), sufficient supplies (you have [confirm supplies]), and knowledge of dangers (you've learned about [mention key dangers like disease, weather, encounters]). [If missing something, state: 'However, you're concerned about [missing element] - this could be a problem in the jungle.']"
- **Failure (Below 11)**: "You think you're ready for jungle travel - you have supplies and a guide - but you're not entirely certain if you're prepared for the specific challenges of Chult's jungle. The wilderness here is unlike anything you've experienced before."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your comprehensive survival assessment confirms: you have a capable guide ([guide name] with [mention guide's strengths]), proper supplies for jungle conditions, and understanding of key dangers (disease, weather, navigation challenges). You've even identified ways to improve your chances: [suggest 1-2 survival tips like extra water storage or better shelter]. You're confident you're ready for what the jungle will throw at you."

**DC 10 Insight Check**: Sense if truly ready or rushing

**What to Say:**

- **Success (10-14)**: "Your instincts tell you that to leave Port Nyanzaru safely, you need: a guide (you have [guide name or 'still need one']), supplies (you have [supplies status]), and a destination (you have [destination or 'no clear destination yet']). [If rushing: 'You sense you might be rushing - there's still [missing element] you should address before leaving.' If ready: 'You feel genuinely prepared and not rushing into danger.']"
- **Failure (Below 10)**: "You feel ready to go, but you can't be certain if you're truly prepared or if you're rushing into danger. The excitement of adventure might be clouding your judgment."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your sharp insight reveals: you have [guide name] as your guide, [supplies status], and [destination status]. [If ready: 'You sense you're genuinely prepared, not rushing, and have addressed the essential elements. You can proceed with confidence.' If not ready: 'You sense you're rushing - you still need [specific missing element]. Taking time to prepare properly will significantly improve your chances of survival.']"
