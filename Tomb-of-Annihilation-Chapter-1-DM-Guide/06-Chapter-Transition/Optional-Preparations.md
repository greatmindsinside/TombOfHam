>
> **First, expedition charter:** The Flaming Fist offers official expedition charters. It's free and provides legal protection against being treated as looters.

Building relationships with them can provide information, safe havens at outposts, potential allies in conflicts, and resources. Faction contacts are optional but can be valuable.

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but want to know about optional prep, if they're uncertain about what's worth pursuing, or when they ask about additional preparation options

### When to Push for Optional Prep

Consider encouraging optional prep if:

- Players are under-leveled
- Players lack resources
- Players seem unprepared
- Players want more structure
- You want to extend Chapter 1

### When to Skip Optional Prep

Consider skipping optional prep if:

- Players are eager to get to the jungle
- Players are well-prepared already
- Time is limited
- Players have clear direction
- You want to move the story forward

## Verifying Optional Preparations

Before allowing departure, check:

- [ ] Do players have a charter? (Optional but helpful)
- [ ] Do players have faction contacts? (Optional but useful)
- [ ] Have players completed side quests? (Optional but beneficial)
- [ ] Do players have a specific destination? (Optional but recommended)
- [ ] Do players have additional supplies? (Optional but helpful)

## What to Say About Optional Prep

### If Players Have Optional Prep

> "You've gone beyond the essentials. You have [list optional prep], which will give you advantages in the jungle. Your preparation is thorough, and you're as ready as you can be. These extra steps will serve you well."

### If Players Skip Optional Prep

> "You have the essentials - guide, supplies, and a lead. While you could pursue [mention optional prep], you feel ready to depart. The jungle awaits, and you're prepared enough to face it. You can always acquire more resources or contacts later if needed."

## Examples of Optional Prep Benefits

### Charter Example

> "With your Flaming Fist charter, the patrol you encounter recognizes your authorization. Instead of demanding bribes or turning you away, they offer information about safe routes and warn you about dangers ahead."

### Faction Contact Example

> "Your contact with the Order of the Gauntlet means Camp Vengeance welcomes you as allies. They share supplies, information, and offer safe rest. Without this contact, they might have been suspicious or demanded payment."

### Side Quest Example

> "The magic item you acquired from completing [side quest] proves invaluable when you encounter [challenge]. Without it, you would have struggled significantly. Your preparation paid off."
