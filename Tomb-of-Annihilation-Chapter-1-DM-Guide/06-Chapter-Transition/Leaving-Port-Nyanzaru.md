## Transition Scene

Once players are ready to depart, describe their exit from the city and entry into the jungle.

## What to Say

> "As you and your guide lead the expedition through the massive gates of Port Nyanzaru, the city bustle fades behind you. The jungle looms ahead - a vast, green wall of vegetation that seems to swallow the horizon. Strange calls echo from the canopy, and the air grows heavier with humidity and the scent of decay.
>
> Your guide pauses at the edge of the trail. 'This is where civilization ends,' they say grimly. 'Stay close, watch your step, and remember: everything in the jungle wants to eat you.'
>
> With that sobering thought, you step into the Land of Chult..."
