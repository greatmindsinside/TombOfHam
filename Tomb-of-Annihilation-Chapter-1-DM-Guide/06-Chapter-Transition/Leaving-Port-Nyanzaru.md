## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about leaving Port Nyanzaru at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "As you approach the massive gates of Port Nyanzaru, this is what you need to understand about leaving:
>
> **First, this is the point of no return:** Once you step through these gates, you're committed to the jungle journey. The city will be behind you, and the wilderness will be ahead. This marks the end of Chapter 1 and the beginning of Chapter 2. Make sure you're ready.
>
> **Second, what awaits you:** The jungle is a vast, green expanse that has claimed the lives of countless explorers. Strange calls echo from the canopy. The air grows heavier with humidity and the scent of decay. Everything in the jungle wants to eat you. Disease, weather, creatures, getting lost, exhaustion - these are daily threats. The jungle doesn't care how prepared you think you are - it will test you every single day.
>
> **Third, your guide is essential:** Your guide knows the terrain, the dangers, and how to survive. Trust them. Follow their lead. They've survived multiple expeditions, and their knowledge is your best defense. Without them, you'll get lost and die. With them, you have a chance.
>
> **Fourth, final preparations:** This is your last chance to check supplies, adjust gear, or make any final arrangements. Once you leave, you're committed. Use skill checks to verify readiness - Perception to spot immediate dangers, Investigation to verify preparation, Survival to assess jungle readiness, and Insight to sense if you're truly ready.
>
> **Fifth, what you should have:** You need a guide (essential), supplies (essential), a solid lead pointing to a destination (essential), and understanding of jungle dangers (important). Optional but recommended: charter, faction contacts, side quest completion, and a specific destination chosen.
>
> **Sixth, the transition:** This is a major mood shift from safe city to dangerous wilderness. The guide's warning sets the tone. The jungle looms ahead - a wall of green that seems to stretch forever. This is where civilization ends, and survival begins.
>
> The gates are opening. The jungle waits. Are you ready?'"

**When to Use This:** If players are at the gates but need comprehensive information, if they're uncertain about readiness, or when doing a final transition check

>
> As you approach, a guard captain steps forward. 'Another expedition heading into the jungle,' he says, his tone matter-of-fact but not unkind. 'I've seen hundreds of you come through these gates. Some return. Most don't. The jungle doesn't care how prepared you think you are - it will test you every single day.'
