## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city of opportunity and danger, and its inhabitants reflect that. As you explore, you'll encounter colorful characters from all walks of life: flamboyant explorers sharing tales in taverns, powerful merchant princes conducting business in opulent offices, and faction representatives operating from shadowy corners. Each person you meet might hold a piece of the puzzle that will help you in your quest to find the Soulmonger.
>
> Some NPCs will approach you directly, while others require you to seek them out. The city rewards those who ask questions, make connections, and build relationships. Choose your allies wisely - in Port Nyanzaru, information is currency, and trust is earned, not given."

## DM Guidance

Introduce NPCs naturally as players explore. Some (like Volo) can be found in specific locations, while others may approach the party. Use NPCs to provide information, quests, and connections. Each NPC should have a clear purpose and personality. Don't overwhelm players - introduce 2-3 key NPCs per session. Use skill checks to reveal NPC motivations and hidden agendas. NPCs can become ongoing allies or contacts throughout the campaign.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about key NPCs at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Port Nyanzaru is full of interesting and powerful people. Here's what you need to know about the key NPCs you'll encounter:
>
> **First, Volo (Volothamp Geddarm):** A famous explorer and author who can be found in taverns. He has extensive knowledge about Chult, jungle locations, and dangers. He's helpful but prone to exaggeration. He can provide information about the Soulmonger, jungle destinations, and expedition planning. He's one of the best sources of information in the city.
>
> **Second, Merchant Princes:** Nine powerful figures who control different aspects of trade in Port Nyanzaru. Each has their own specialty: Kwayothe controls guides and expeditions, Jessamine controls magic items, Jobal controls dinosaurs, and others control various trade aspects. They can provide specialized services, information, and connections. Building relationships with them can be valuable.
>
> **Third, Faction Representatives:** Various organizations operate in Port Nyanzaru - Harpers (information network, helpful), Flaming Fist (law enforcement, charters), Order of the Gauntlet (holy warriors), Emerald Enclave (nature protectors), Lords' Alliance (political connections), and Zhentarim (shadowy operators). Each can provide different types of assistance, information, or resources.
>
> **Fourth, how to interact:** Use skill checks to read NPC motivations, verify information, and build relationships. Not all NPCs are trustworthy - some have hidden agendas. Use Insight to detect deception, Investigation to verify claims, and Persuasion to build rapport.
>
> **Fifth, building relationships:** NPCs can become valuable allies throughout your journey. Building positive relationships can provide ongoing benefits - information, resources, assistance, or connections. Treat NPCs well, and they may help you when you need it most.
>
> The people of Port Nyanzaru are as diverse as the city itself. Some will help you, some will use you, and some will try to stop you. Choose your allies wisely.'"

**When to Use This:** If players are overwhelmed by NPCs, if they need to understand who's important, or after a very successful History check (DC 17+)

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe NPCs for signs of their true nature or intentions

- **Success**: "You notice subtle details about the NPCs you encounter: the way they carry themselves, the quality of their clothing, the company they keep. Some appear genuinely helpful, while others seem to be hiding something. You can identify which NPCs might be trustworthy versus those who have hidden agendas."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs seem friendly enough, but you can't get a clear read on their true intentions or backgrounds."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you can identify specific tells that reveal NPC motivations, notice hidden weapons or magical items, spot faction symbols or affiliations, and even detect subtle signs of wealth or influence. You can distinguish between NPCs who are genuinely helpful, those who want something from you, and those who might be dangerous."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Gather information about NPCs from their surroundings or reputation

- **Success**: "By examining the NPCs' clothing, equipment, and the places they frequent, you can piece together information about their backgrounds, wealth, and connections. You notice which NPCs have influence in the city and which are just trying to get by."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' backgrounds are difficult to determine from casual observation."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you can identify NPCs' social standing, their connections to merchant princes or factions, their areas of expertise, and even rumors about their past activities. You learn which NPCs have valuable information, which can provide services, and which might be dangerous to cross."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read NPCs' emotional states and detect deception

- **Success**: "You can sense the NPCs' true feelings beneath their words. Some are genuinely helpful, while others are hiding information or have ulterior motives. You can identify which NPCs are trustworthy and which you should approach with caution."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' emotional states are difficult to read, and you can't determine if they're being truthful."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific emotions (fear, greed, desperation, hope), identify when NPCs are lying or holding back information, sense hidden agendas or secrets, and even predict how NPCs will react to different approaches. You can identify the best way to interact with each NPC to get what you need."

**DC 12 History Check**: Recall information about NPCs' reputations or backgrounds

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about some of these NPCs before. Volo is a famous explorer and author, known for his exaggerated but often useful travel guides. The merchant princes are well-known figures in trading circles. Faction representatives often have reputations that precede them."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' names don't ring any bells, though they clearly have some standing in the city."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you recall detailed information about Volo's past adventures and his reputation for both helpful information and self-aggrandizement. You know which merchant princes control which aspects of trade, their political relationships, and their reputations. You're aware of faction activities in Port Nyanzaru and can identify which representatives are trustworthy versus those with questionable motives."

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Build rapport with NPCs to gain their trust

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest in their stories helps build rapport. The NPCs become more open, sharing additional information or offering to help in ways they wouldn't for strangers."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs remain polite but guarded, sharing only basic information."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your charisma and approach are so effective that NPCs become genuinely helpful allies. They share valuable information, offer discounts on services, introduce you to other useful contacts, and may even provide assistance later in your journey. Some NPCs might offer to join you on your expedition or provide resources."

**DC 10 Deception Check**: Detect if NPCs are lying or withholding information

- **Success**: "You can tell when NPCs are being less than truthful. Some are exaggerating their knowledge, while others are hiding important information. You can identify which claims to trust and which to question."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs seem sincere, but you can't be certain if they're telling the whole truth."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your ability to detect deception is sharp: you can identify specific lies, determine what information NPCs are hiding and why, and even catch subtle inconsistencies in their stories. You can call out falsehoods effectively, potentially forcing NPCs to reveal the truth or admit their deceptions."

## Encounter: Meeting Merchant Prince Kwayothe

Use this encounter when players need to hire guides or want to meet one of the most important NPCs in Port Nyanzaru.

**Location:** Merchant Prince Kwayothe's Office, Port Nyanzaru

### Encounter Setup

Players seek out Merchant Prince Kwayothe at her office or are directed to her for guide services. She controls the guide trade in Port Nyanzaru.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "Merchant Prince Kwayothe's office is opulent but functional - a space that speaks of wealth and power, but also of someone who understands the practical needs of expeditions. Maps cover the walls, and shelves are filled with expedition reports and guide profiles.
>
> Kwayothe herself is an imposing figure - a middle-aged woman with sharp eyes and the bearing of someone who's built an empire. She looks up from a stack of documents as you enter, her expression assessing but not unfriendly.
>
> 'Ah, newcomers seeking guides,' she says, her voice carrying the authority of someone who's made this introduction countless times. 'I am Kwayothe, and I control the guide trade in Port Nyanzaru. Every guide worth hiring comes through me. The jungle is no place for amateurs, and I make sure only the best guides work in my city.'
>
> She gestures to several figures waiting in an antechamber. 'These are some of my finest guides, each with their own specialties and knowledge. Choosing the right guide is one of the most important decisions you'll make - your lives may depend on it. Let me introduce you to your options...'"

### Encounter Options

1. **Listen to introductions** - Hear about available guides
2. **Ask questions** - Inquire about guide specialties and experience

5. **Negotiate terms** - Try to get better deals or more information
6. **Build relationship** - Use social skills to gain Kwayothe's favor

### Encounter Skill Checks

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research Kwayothe's reputation and guide quality

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you learn that Kwayothe is indeed the primary controller of guide services in Port Nyanzaru. Her guides are generally high-quality, though they come at premium prices. She has a reputation for being fair but business-focused."
- **Failure**: "Kwayothe's reputation is difficult to verify, and you can't determine the quality of her guides or her business practices."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: Kwayothe has built a legitimate guide empire, her guides are consistently among the best available, she maintains quality standards, and she has connections throughout Chult. However, you also learn she takes significant commissions and may prioritize her own interests. You understand how to navigate her system effectively."

**DC 12 Insight Check**: Read Kwayothe's true motivations and detect her agenda

- **Success**: "You can sense Kwayothe is genuinely committed to providing quality guides, but she's also running a business. She wants to help expeditions succeed (it's good for her reputation), but she also wants to maximize profits. She's not trying to cheat you, but she's not going to give you discounts either."
- **Failure**: "Kwayothe seems professional and helpful, but you can't determine her true motivations or if she has hidden agendas."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect Kwayothe's specific motivations (business success, maintaining quality reputation, building connections), identify when she's being less than completely transparent, sense her expectations, and even predict how she'll react to different approaches. You can navigate the relationship to maximize benefits."

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Build rapport and potentially get better terms or information

- **Success**: "Your diplomatic approach helps you build a positive relationship with Kwayothe. She becomes more helpful, may provide additional information about guides, and might offer to arrange better terms or introduce you to guides not initially presented."
- **Failure**: "Kwayothe remains professional but sticks to standard terms and doesn't provide additional benefits."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your approach is highly effective: Kwayothe becomes genuinely supportive. She provides detailed information about all available guides, offers to arrange interviews, may provide discounts or additional services, and even shares valuable information about jungle dangers or expedition planning. You gain a valuable ally in Port Nyanzaru."

### Reward

- **Potential Discounts** - Better terms if successful Persuasion check
- **Information** - Insights about jungle dangers, expedition planning, or Chult
