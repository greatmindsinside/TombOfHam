## What to Say

As you explore, you'll encounter colorful characters from all walks of life: flamboyant explorers sharing tales in taverns, powerful merchant princes conducting business in opulent offices, and faction representatives operating from shadowy corners. Each person you meet might hold a piece of the puzzle that will help you in your quest to find the Soulmonger.
>

## DM Guidance

Introduce NPCs naturally as players explore. Some (like Volo) can be found in specific locations, while others may approach the party. Use NPCs to provide information, quests, and connections. Each NPC should have a clear purpose and personality. Don't overwhelm players - introduce 2-3 key NPCs per session. Use skill checks to reveal NPC motivations and hidden agendas. NPCs can become ongoing allies or contacts throughout the campaign.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe NPCs for signs of their true nature or intentions

- **Success**: "You notice subtle details about the NPCs you encounter: the way they carry themselves, the quality of their clothing, the company they keep. Some appear genuinely helpful, while others seem to be hiding something. You can identify which NPCs might be trustworthy versus those who have hidden agendas."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs seem friendly enough, but you can't get a clear read on their true intentions or backgrounds."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you can identify specific tells that reveal NPC motivations, notice hidden weapons or magical items, spot faction symbols or affiliations, and even detect subtle signs of wealth or influence. You can distinguish between NPCs who are genuinely helpful, those who want something from you, and those who might be dangerous."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Gather information about NPCs from their surroundings or reputation

- **Success**: "By examining the NPCs' clothing, equipment, and the places they frequent, you can piece together information about their backgrounds, wealth, and connections. You notice which NPCs have influence in the city and which are just trying to get by."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' backgrounds are difficult to determine from casual observation."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you can identify NPCs' social standing, their connections to merchant princes or factions, their areas of expertise, and even rumors about their past activities. You learn which NPCs have valuable information, which can provide services, and which might be dangerous to cross."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Read NPCs' emotional states and detect deception

- **Success**: "You can sense the NPCs' true feelings beneath their words. Some are genuinely helpful, while others are hiding information or have ulterior motives. You can identify which NPCs are trustworthy and which you should approach with caution."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' emotional states are difficult to read, and you can't determine if they're being truthful."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific emotions (fear, greed, desperation, hope), identify when NPCs are lying or holding back information, sense hidden agendas or secrets, and even predict how NPCs will react to different approaches. You can identify the best way to interact with each NPC to get what you need."

**DC 12 History Check**: Recall information about NPCs' reputations or backgrounds

- **Success**: "You remember hearing about some of these NPCs before. Volo is a famous explorer and author, known for his exaggerated but often useful travel guides. The merchant princes are well-known figures in trading circles. Faction representatives often have reputations that precede them."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs' names don't ring any bells, though they clearly have some standing in the city."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you recall detailed information about Volo's past adventures and his reputation for both helpful information and self-aggrandizement. You know which merchant princes control which aspects of trade, their political relationships, and their reputations. You're aware of faction activities in Port Nyanzaru and can identify which representatives are trustworthy versus those with questionable motives."

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Build rapport with NPCs to gain their trust

- **Success**: "Your friendly approach and genuine interest in their stories helps build rapport. The NPCs become more open, sharing additional information or offering to help in ways they wouldn't for strangers."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs remain polite but guarded, sharing only basic information."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your charisma and approach are so effective that NPCs become genuinely helpful allies. They share valuable information, offer discounts on services, introduce you to other useful contacts, and may even provide assistance later in your journey. Some NPCs might offer to join you on your expedition or provide resources."

**DC 10 Deception Check**: Detect if NPCs are lying or withholding information

- **Success**: "You can tell when NPCs are being less than truthful. Some are exaggerating their knowledge, while others are hiding important information. You can identify which claims to trust and which to question."
- **Failure**: "The NPCs seem sincere, but you can't be certain if they're telling the whole truth."
- **Critical Success (15+)**: "Your ability to detect deception is sharp: you can identify specific lies, determine what information NPCs are hiding and why, and even catch subtle inconsistencies in their stories. You can call out falsehoods effectively, potentially forcing NPCs to reveal the truth or admit their deceptions."
