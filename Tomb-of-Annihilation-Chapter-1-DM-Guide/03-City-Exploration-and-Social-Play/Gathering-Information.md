# Gathering Information in Port Nyanzaru

*Official source: Gathering information: **p. 31***  
*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city of secrets and stories. Every conversation might hold a clue, every rumor might point the way, and every contact might provide the information you need to find the Soulmonger. As you explore the city, you'll encounter countless opportunities to gather information - from flamboyant explorers sharing tales in taverns to powerful merchant princes conducting business, from faction representatives operating in the shadows to local guides who know the jungle's secrets.
>
> Information is currency in Port Nyanzaru, and those who know how to ask the right questions, build the right relationships, and read between the lines will find the clues they need. But be careful - not all information is reliable, and some sources might have their own agendas. Trust, but verify. And remember: the most valuable information often comes from the most unexpected sources."

## What Players Find

- Multiple information sources: Volo, Merchant Princes, factions, guides, locals
- Rumors about the Death Curse, Soulmonger, and jungle locations
- Opportunities in taverns, markets, temples, and public spaces
- Information that may be true, false, or partially accurate
- Connections between different sources and pieces of information

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Visit taverns** - Listen to rumors, meet contacts, gather general information
2. **Shop in markets** - Overhear conversations while browsing
3. **Attend temples** - Seek blessings and information from religious sources
4. **Watch dinosaur races** - Meet underworld contacts and gather rumors
5. **Seek faction representatives** - Get official information from organizations
6. **Use skill checks** - Investigate, persuade, and gather information actively

## DM Guidance

Dole out information gradually to build mystery and engagement. Use rumor tables to provide clues about the Soulmonger and jungle locations. Not all information should be reliable - some rumors may be false or misleading. Players should leave this phase with at least one solid lead pointing into the jungle. Balance information gathering with other activities. Use skill checks to reveal information naturally rather than just giving it away. Use this phase to build excitement about the jungle while establishing that preparation is crucial. Balance information gathering with opportunities for social interaction and character development.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about gathering information at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city of secrets and stories, and information is currency here. To find the Soulmonger, you'll need to gather clues from multiple sources. Here's what you need to know:
>
> **First, where to find information:** You can gather information from several sources. Volo, the famous explorer, can be found in taverns and has extensive knowledge about Chult. Merchant Princes control different aspects of the city and have specialized knowledge. Faction representatives (Harpers, Flaming Fist, etc.) have their own information networks. Local guides know practical jungle knowledge. And taverns are full of rumors - some true, some false, all potentially valuable.
>
> **Second, what information you need:** You need at least one solid lead pointing to a jungle location. This could be information about Omu (the Forbidden City), Orolunga (the oracle ziggurat), or other locations. You also need to understand jungle dangers - disease, weather, navigation challenges, encounters, and resource management. And you need practical knowledge about guides, supplies, and expedition planning.
>
> **Third, how to verify information:** Not all information is reliable. Some rumors are false or exaggerated. Use skill checks to verify information - Investigation to cross-reference sources, Insight to detect deception, and Persuasion to build relationships with reliable sources. Trust, but verify.
>
> **Fourth, the importance of preparation:** Information gathering isn't just about finding the Soulmonger - it's about understanding what you'll face. Learn about jungle dangers, find reliable guides, identify essential supplies, and understand the political landscape. The more you know, the better prepared you'll be.
>
> Information is everywhere in Port Nyanzaru, but the most valuable information often comes from the most unexpected sources. Ask questions, build relationships, and don't take everything at face value."

**When to Use This:** If players are overwhelmed by information gathering options, if they need a clear overview of what information is available, or after a very successful Investigation check (DC 18+)

## Encounter: The Information Broker

Use this encounter when players need to obtain specific information about the Soulmonger, jungle locations, or expedition planning, and want to pay for reliable intelligence.

**Location:** Tavern, Grand Souk Market, or Streets of Port Nyanzaru

### Encounter Setup

Players encounter an information broker in a tavern, market, or other public space who offers to sell valuable information for a price or favor.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "As you [location activity], a [description] individual approaches you. They have the bearing of someone who deals in secrets - their eyes are sharp, their movements are calculated, and they carry themselves with the confidence of someone who knows things others don't.
>
> 'I couldn't help but notice you're new to Port Nyanzaru,' they say, their voice low and measured. 'Planning an expedition, are you? Looking for information about the Death Curse, perhaps? The Soulmonger?'
>
> They pause, letting the words hang in the air. 'Information is valuable in this city, and I happen to have some that might interest you. I know things about the jungle, about the locations you're seeking, about what you'll face out there. But information like this... it doesn't come free.'
>
> They lean closer, their expression serious. 'I can tell you about Omu - the old city where the Soulmonger is said to be. I can tell you about the dangers you'll face, the routes that are safest, the guides who are reliable. But it'll cost you. Either gold, or a favor. What do you say?'"

### Encounter Options

1. **Pay for information** - Agree to pay gold for the information
2. **Offer a favor** - Agree to do something in exchange for information
3. **Negotiate terms** - Try to get better prices or more information
4. **Use skill checks** - Investigate the broker's reliability, detect deception
5. **Decline** - Say you'll find information elsewhere
6. **Threaten or intimidate** - Try to force information (risky)

### Encounter Skill Checks

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Verify the broker's reliability and the value of their information

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you can learn about the broker's reputation. They seem to have legitimate sources and have provided reliable information to others in the past. Their information appears to be valuable, though you can't verify all of it."
- **Failure**: "The broker's reputation is difficult to verify, and you can't determine if their information is reliable or if they're just trying to make a sale."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you learn the broker has a solid reputation for providing accurate information, verify some of their claims through other sources, discover what information they actually have access to, and even identify potential complications or hidden costs. You can make a highly informed decision about whether to trust them."

**DC 12 Insight Check**: Detect if the broker is being truthful or has hidden agendas

- **Success**: "You can sense the broker is generally truthful about having information, though they may be exaggerating its value or holding back some details. They seem to want payment more than they want to deceive you, but you should verify what they're offering."
- **Failure**: "The broker seems sincere, but you can't determine if they're being completely truthful or if they have hidden agendas."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect the broker's specific motivations (profit, building connections, potential hidden agendas), identify what information they genuinely have versus what they're exaggerating, sense if they're holding back important details, and even predict how they'll react to different negotiation approaches. You can navigate the interaction effectively."

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Negotiate better terms or get more information

- **Success**: "Your diplomatic approach helps you negotiate better terms. The broker becomes more open, may lower their price, or might provide additional information as part of the deal. They may even offer to verify information or provide contacts."
- **Failure**: "The broker sticks to their asking price and terms, unwilling to negotiate or provide additional information."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your negotiation is highly effective: you can secure significantly better terms (lower price, more information, additional services), get the broker to share information they normally wouldn't, build a relationship that provides ongoing benefits, and even convince them to provide verification or contacts. You gain valuable information and a potential ongoing source."

### Reward

- **Valuable Information** - Details about the Soulmonger, jungle locations, or expedition planning
- **Reliable Intelligence** - Verified information about dangers, routes, or guides
- **Contacts** - Potential introductions to other NPCs or resources

### Using This Encounter
