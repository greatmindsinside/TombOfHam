## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city of secrets and stories. Every conversation might hold a clue, every rumor might point the way, and every contact might provide the information you need to find the Soulmonger. As you explore the city, you'll encounter countless opportunities to gather information - from flamboyant explorers sharing tales in taverns to powerful merchant princes conducting business, from faction representatives operating in the shadows to local guides who know the jungle's secrets.
>
> Information is currency in Port Nyanzaru, and those who know how to ask the right questions, build the right relationships, and read between the lines will find the clues they need. But be careful - not all information is reliable, and some sources might have their own agendas. Trust, but verify. And remember: the most valuable information often comes from the most unexpected sources."

## DM Guidance

Dole out information gradually to build mystery and engagement. Use rumor tables to provide clues about the Soulmonger and jungle locations. Not all information should be reliable - some rumors may be false or misleading. Players should leave this phase with at least one solid lead pointing into the jungle. Balance information gathering with other activities. Use skill checks to reveal information naturally rather than just giving it away. Use this phase to build excitement about the jungle while establishing that preparation is crucial. Balance information gathering with opportunities for social interaction and character development.
