## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city ruled by power and profit. As you explore, you'll quickly realize that the city's true rulers are the Merchant Princes - nine powerful individuals who control different aspects of trade and commerce. Each prince has their own territory, their own interests, and their own methods of maintaining power.
>
> The Goldenthrone Palace stands as a symbol of their collective authority, where important decisions are made and expeditions are officially sanctioned. But the Merchant Princes aren't the only powers in the city. Representatives from major Faerûnian factions operate here as well, each with their own agendas and resources.
>
> Understanding this power structure is crucial. The right connections can open doors, provide information, and grant you access to resources you'll need for your journey. But cross the wrong person, and you might find yourself facing obstacles at every turn."

## DM Guidance

The power structure is important but shouldn't overwhelm players. Introduce it gradually as they explore. Use skill checks to reveal political dynamics and relationships. Each Merchant Prince and faction should have clear areas of influence. Players don't need to interact with all of them - let them choose which connections to pursue. Political maneuvering can provide benefits but also create complications. Balance the intrigue with the main quest.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe signs of political power and influence

- **Success**: "You notice subtle indicators of power throughout the city: certain buildings are better maintained and more heavily guarded, specific symbols and colors mark different territories, and people show deference to certain individuals. You can identify which areas belong to which Merchant Prince and where faction representatives operate."
- **Failure**: "The city seems unified, and you can't clearly identify the power structure or territorial divisions."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is comprehensive: you can map out the entire political landscape, identify which Merchant Princes control which districts, spot faction symbols and meeting places, notice subtle conflicts and alliances, and even detect which areas are contested or neutral. You understand the power dynamics at play."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research the Merchant Princes and their specializations

- **Success**: "Through observation and asking the right questions, you learn about the Merchant Princes: their areas of specialization, their reputations, and how they maintain their power. You understand which princes control which aspects of trade and can identify who to approach for specific needs."
- **Failure**: "The Merchant Princes are powerful figures, but their specific roles and relationships are unclear."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you know each Merchant Prince's specialty, their political relationships (who are allies, who are rivals), their methods of operation, and even rumors about their personal agendas. You can identify which princes might be helpful allies, which to avoid, and how to approach each one effectively."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 11 History Check**: Recall information about Port Nyanzaru's political structure

- **Success**: "You remember that Port Nyanzaru is ruled by Merchant Princes who control different aspects of trade. The city has a unique political system where economic power translates directly to political authority. The Goldenthrone Palace serves as their meeting place and the seat of government."
- **Failure**: "You know the city has powerful rulers, but the specific political structure is unclear."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: you know the Merchant Princes originally numbered seven but have varied over time, currently standing at nine. You understand their system of governance, how they maintain power through economic control, and their relationships with foreign powers. You're aware of past conflicts between princes and how the current balance of power was established. You also know about the factions operating in the city and their historical relationships with the Merchant Princes."

**DC 13 Insight Check**: Sense political tensions and alliances

- **Success**: "You can sense the underlying political currents. While the city appears unified on the surface, there are subtle tensions between different Merchant Princes and factions. You can identify which groups are allies, which are rivals, and where conflicts might arise."
- **Failure**: "The political situation seems stable, though you suspect there might be tensions you're not picking up on."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your insight reveals detailed political dynamics: you can identify specific alliances and rivalries, sense which Merchant Princes are gaining or losing power, detect hidden conflicts and agendas, and even predict how political maneuvering might affect your quest. You understand which factions support which princes and how the Death Curse has created new opportunities for political maneuvering."

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Navigate political relationships to gain favor

- **Success**: "Your diplomatic approach helps you navigate the political landscape. You can gain audiences with Merchant Princes or faction representatives, and they're more willing to help or share information."
- **Failure**: "The political powers remain distant, and you struggle to gain meaningful access or assistance."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your political acumen is impressive: you can build relationships with multiple Merchant Princes and factions, gain their trust and favor, and even navigate conflicts between them. You might gain powerful allies who can provide resources, information, and protection. Some might even offer to support your expedition directly."

**DC 11 Investigation Check**: Learn about faction activities and goals

- **Success**: "You can identify the various factions operating in Port Nyanzaru and understand their general goals. The Harpers seek to help those in need, the Flaming Fist maintains order, the Zhentarim pursue profit and power, and other factions have their own agendas."
- **Failure**: "The factions are secretive, and their goals are unclear."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed faction information: you know each faction's specific goals in Port Nyanzaru, their methods of operation, their relationships with Merchant Princes, and even some of their hidden activities. You can identify which factions might be helpful allies, which to avoid, and how to approach each one. You might even learn about faction conflicts or secret alliances."
