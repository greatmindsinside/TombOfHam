## What to Say

> "Port Nyanzaru is a city ruled by power and profit. As you explore, you'll quickly realize that the city's true rulers are the Merchant Princes - nine powerful individuals who control different aspects of trade and commerce. Each prince has their own territory, their own interests, and their own methods of maintaining power.
>
> The Goldenthrone Palace stands as a symbol of their collective authority, where important decisions are made and expeditions are officially sanctioned. But the Merchant Princes aren't the only powers in the city. Representatives from major Faerûnian factions operate here as well, each with their own agendas and resources.
>
> Understanding this power structure is crucial. The right connections can open doors, provide information, and grant you access to resources you'll need for your journey. But cross the wrong person, and you might find yourself facing obstacles at every turn."

## What Players Discover

- Nine Merchant Princes controlling different aspects of trade
- The Goldenthrone Palace as the seat of power
- Multiple Faerûnian factions with representatives in the city
- Political tensions and alliances between different powers
- The importance of understanding who controls what

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Observe the power structure** - Use Perception/Investigation to identify who controls what (see Skill Checks below)
2. **Seek audiences with Merchant Princes** → [Key-NPCs.md](./Key-NPCs.md) - Approach specific princes for their expertise
3. **Contact faction representatives** → [Key-NPCs.md](./Key-NPCs.md) - Reach out to Harpers, Flaming Fist, or other factions
4. **Research political relationships** - Use History/Insight to understand alliances and rivalries (see Skill Checks below)
5. **Navigate political waters** - Use Persuasion to build relationships and gain favor (see Skill Checks below)
6. **Visit Goldenthrone Palace** → [Expedition-Charter.md](../05-Outfitting-and-Preparation/Expedition-Charter.md) - Seek official meetings or charters

## DM Guidance

The power structure is important but shouldn't overwhelm players. Introduce it gradually as they explore. Use skill checks to reveal political dynamics and relationships. Each Merchant Prince and faction should have clear areas of influence. Players don't need to interact with all of them - let them choose which connections to pursue. Political maneuvering can provide benefits but also create complications. Balance the intrigue with the main quest.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about the power structure at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "Port Nyanzaru's power structure is unique and complex. Here's what you need to know:
>
> **First, Merchant Princes:** Nine powerful figures who control different aspects of trade. Economic power translates directly to political authority. Each controls a specialty: Kwayothe (guides), Jessamine (magic items), Jobal (dinosaurs), and others control various trade aspects. They meet at Goldenthrone Palace, the seat of government. Building relationships with them can provide valuable services, information, and connections.
>
> **Second, Factions:** Various organizations operate in the city. Harpers provide information networks and help those in need. Flaming Fist maintains order and provides expedition charters. Order of the Gauntlet fights evil and protects the innocent. Emerald Enclave protects nature. Lords' Alliance maintains political connections. Zhentarim operates in shadows, pursuing profit and power. Each has different goals and can provide different types of assistance.
>
> **Third, political dynamics:** While the city appears unified, there are tensions between different Merchant Princes and factions. Some are allies, some are rivals. The Death Curse has created new opportunities for political maneuvering. Understanding these relationships can help you navigate the political landscape.
>
> **Fourth, how to navigate:** Use skill checks to understand political dynamics, build relationships, and gain favor. Investigation to research reputations, Insight to sense tensions and alliances, and Persuasion to build relationships. Political connections can provide resources, information, and protection, but they can also create obligations or conflicts.
>
> **Fifth, the value of connections:** Political connections are optional but can be valuable. They can provide supplies, information, charters, faction support, and ongoing assistance. However, they may come with expectations or obligations. Choose your connections wisely.
>
> The political landscape of Port Nyanzaru is complex, but understanding it can provide valuable advantages. Navigate carefully, and you may gain powerful allies.'"

## Encounter: Political Maneuvering

Use this encounter when players need to navigate the political landscape of Port Nyanzaru, whether seeking favor with a Merchant Prince, dealing with faction representatives, or understanding political dynamics.

**Location:** Streets of Port Nyanzaru, Merchant Prince Offices, or Faction Headquarters

### Encounter Setup

Players are approached by a faction representative or Merchant Prince agent who wants to discuss their expedition and potentially form an alliance or make a deal.

### Encounter Dialogue

> "As you explore Port Nyanzaru, a well-dressed individual approaches you. They have the bearing of someone who represents power - their clothes are fine, their manner is polished, and they move with the confidence of someone who knows their place in the city's hierarchy.
>
> 'Excuse me,' they say with a diplomatic smile. 'I represent [Faction/Merchant Prince Name], and we've been watching your activities in the city. We understand you're planning an expedition to deal with this... Death Curse situation. That's a matter of concern to us as well.'
>
> They pause, assessing your reaction. 'We believe our interests align. We can offer you resources, information, and connections that could prove valuable on your journey. In return, we'd like you to share what you learn about the Soulmonger and its location. We're not asking you to work for us - we're proposing a partnership. What do you say?'"

### Encounter Options

1. **Accept the offer** - Agree to the partnership or alliance
2. **Ask questions** - Inquire about what they want and what they'll provide
3. **Negotiate terms** - Try to get better conditions or more resources
4. **Use skill checks** - Investigate the faction, read their true motivations
5. **Decline politely** - Say you prefer to remain independent
6. **Play factions against each other** - Use information to negotiate with multiple groups

### Encounter Skill Checks

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Research the faction or Merchant Prince and their reputation

- **Success**: "By asking around and investigating, you can learn about the faction's or Merchant Prince's reputation, their goals, their methods, and how they've treated previous partners. You understand what you're getting into."
- **Failure**: "The faction's or Merchant Prince's background is difficult to verify, and you can't determine their true nature or reliability."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: you learn about the faction's complete history, their true goals, their methods, their relationships with other powers, and even rumors about their hidden agendas. You understand exactly what they want and what they're likely to provide. You can make a highly informed decision."

**DC 12 Insight Check**: Read the representative's true motivations and detect hidden agendas

- **Success**: "You can sense the representative's true motivations. They seem genuinely interested in your mission, but you detect they may have their own goals regarding the Soulmonger or Chult's resources. They're not trying to deceive you, but they're not sharing everything either."
- **Failure**: "The representative seems sincere, but you can't determine their true motivations or if they have hidden agendas."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your insight is penetrating: you can detect specific motivations (genuine concern about the Death Curse, desire for information, potential resource interests), identify what they're not sharing, sense their expectations, and even predict how they'll react if you accept or decline. You understand the full political implications."

**DC 13 Persuasion Check**: Negotiate better terms or build a more favorable relationship

- **Success**: "Your diplomatic approach helps you negotiate better terms. The representative becomes more open, may offer additional resources or information, and might be willing to adjust the partnership conditions in your favor."
- **Failure**: "The representative sticks to their initial offer and isn't willing to negotiate or provide additional benefits."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your negotiation is highly effective: you can secure significantly better terms (more resources, better information sharing, reduced obligations), build a positive relationship that provides ongoing advantages, and even convince them to provide immediate benefits like contacts, supplies, or information. You gain a valuable political ally."

### Reward

- **Political Connection** - Relationship with a powerful faction or Merchant Prince
- **Resources** - Potential access to supplies, information, or support
- **Information** - Insights about the Soulmonger, jungle locations, or political dynamics
