# Meeting Volo in Port Nyanzaru

*Official source: City Denizens (including Volo): **pp. 24-25***  
*Pronunciation: Volo (VOH-loh), Volothamp Geddarm (VOH-loh-thamp GED-darm)*  
*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

**Location:** Thundering Lizard Tavern, Port Nyanzaru

## What to Say

> "You find a bustling tavern called the Thundering Lizard. Inside, adventurers, guides, and merchants mingle over drinks and food. The air is thick with conversation, the clink of tankards, and the occasional burst of laughter or argument.
>
> In a corner, a flamboyant figure holds court. He's a middle-aged man with an elaborate mustache, wearing colorful but practical travel clothes. A quill and inkwell sit on the table before him, along with a half-finished manuscript. He's regaling a small crowd with animated tales, gesturing wildly as he speaks.
>
> 'Ah, newcomers!' he calls out as he spots you. 'Volothamp Geddarm, at your service! But you can call me Volo - everyone does. Come, sit! I've been waiting for adventurers like yourselves. I have stories to tell, and information that might just save your lives in the jungle ahead.'"

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "My friends, you're clearly serious about this quest. Let me tell you what you absolutely must know before venturing into the jungle.
>
> **First, where to go:** I've heard rumors that the Soulmonger - the source of this Death Curse - lies in what the locals call the 'old city,' somewhere deep in the jungle interior. Some call it Omu - the Forbidden City. There's also talk of an oracle ziggurat called Orolunga that might know where the Soulmonger is. Either could be your destination.
>
> **Second, the dangers:** The jungle will try to kill you every single day. Disease from mosquitoes and contaminated water - you'll need insect repellent and clean water sources. Weather that can kill - extreme heat causes exhaustion, storms destroy supplies. Navigation is impossible without a guide - you'll get lost and die. Random encounters are constant - dinosaurs, undead, hostile tribes, natural hazards. Resources are limited - you can't carry everything, and running out means death. Exhaustion kills - it's cumulative and recovery is difficult.
>
> **Third, what you need:** A guide is absolutely essential - not optional. You cannot survive without one. Proper supplies are critical - food, water, insect repellent, tents, rain catchers. Missing any of these could mean death.
>
> The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Those who venture unprepared rarely return. Prepare properly, or don't go at all."

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but lack essential information, or after a very successful Persuasion check (DC 17+)

## What Players See

- Colorful but practical travel clothes
- Writing materials on his table (quill, ink, manuscript)
- Animated storytelling and enthusiastic personality
- A small crowd of listeners hanging on his words
- The bearing of someone who's traveled extensively

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Approach and listen** - Sit down and hear what Volo has to say
2. **Ask specific questions** - Inquire about the jungle, Soulmonger, or Chult
3. **Use skill checks** - Investigate, persuade, or read Volo's reliability
4. **Buy him a drink** - Build rapport through generosity
5. **Share your own stories** - Connect through shared adventuring experiences
6. **Ask about his writing** - Inquire about his current project or past works

## DM Guidance

Volo is a colorful, helpful NPC who provides valuable information but tends to exaggerate. He's genuinely knowledgeable about Chult but may embellish his own accomplishments. Use him to provide essential information about jungle dangers, the importance of guides, and rumors about the Soulmonger. He can be a recurring character who may want to follow the party to write about their adventures. Make him entertaining but useful - his information should be valuable even if his delivery is flamboyant.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe Volo's true nature and reliability

- **Success**: "You notice that despite his flamboyant personality, Volo's equipment shows signs of genuine travel and adventure. His clothes are well-worn but practical, and you spot several small scars that suggest real danger. His enthusiasm seems genuine, though you sense he might be prone to exaggeration."
- **Failure**: "Volo seems like a friendly storyteller, but you can't determine how reliable his information might be."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you notice that Volo's equipment and bearing suggest extensive real-world experience, not just tall tales. His scars and travel-worn gear indicate genuine adventures. You can tell he's knowledgeable but likely prone to self-aggrandizement. His information will probably be useful, but you should verify the more dramatic claims."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine Volo's manuscript and research his reputation

- **Success**: "Looking at Volo's manuscript and asking around, you learn that Volothamp Geddarm is indeed a famous explorer and author. His travel guides are well-known, though they have a reputation for being both helpful and slightly exaggerated. His information about Chult is considered generally reliable, if sometimes embellished."
- **Failure**: "You can't verify much about Volo's background or reputation."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: Volo is a legitimate explorer and author whose works are widely read. His information is generally reliable, though he's known for exaggerating his own role in events. He's written extensively about various regions of Faerûn and has a reputation for being helpful to adventurers. His knowledge of Chult is considered valuable, and he's known to have connections with various factions and NPCs throughout the region."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Get Volo to share useful information

- **Success**: "Volo's eyes light up at your interest. 'Ah, you want to know about Chult? Well, my friends, you've come to the right person! I've spent considerable time here, and I can tell you this: the jungle is no place for the unprepared. Disease is rampant - mosquitoes carry shivering sickness, contaminated water brings dysentery, and the heat itself can kill you. But more than that, the jungle is home to creatures that would make a dragon think twice. Dinosaurs, of course, but also things far worse. And guides? Absolutely essential. You cannot survive the jungle without someone who knows its secrets.'"
- **Failure**: "Volo seems friendly but doesn't share much beyond general pleasantries."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Volo becomes quite talkative: 'My friends, you're clearly serious adventurers! Let me tell you what I know. The jungle is deadly - disease, monsters, hostile tribes, and the environment itself will kill the unprepared. Guides are not optional - they're essential. I've heard rumors, mind you, just rumors, that the source of this Death Curse - this Soulmonger you're seeking - lies in what the locals call the "old city" somewhere deep in the jungle interior. An ancient place, full of danger. But that's just what I've heard from various sources. The jungle holds many secrets, and not all of them are safe to uncover.'"

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Detect when Volo is exaggerating

- **Success**: "You can tell that Volo is prone to exaggeration, especially when talking about his own accomplishments. However, his core information about Chult seems genuine, even if he embellishes the details. You can distinguish between his reliable knowledge and his self-aggrandizing stories."
- **Failure**: "Volo seems sincere, but you can't tell if he's exaggerating or being completely truthful."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is sharp: you can clearly identify when Volo is exaggerating (usually when talking about himself) versus when he's sharing genuine knowledge (usually when discussing Chult's dangers or locations). You notice he becomes more reliable when discussing facts he's learned from others versus his own adventures. His information about the jungle, guides, and the Soulmonger seems to come from reliable sources, even if he presents it dramatically."

**DC 12 History Check**: Recall Volo's reputation and past works

- **Success**: "You remember that Volothamp Geddarm is a famous explorer and author. His travel guides are well-known throughout Faerûn, and he's written extensively about various regions. He has a reputation for being helpful to adventurers, though his accounts are sometimes exaggerated. His information is generally considered reliable, if sometimes embellished."
- **Failure**: "The name sounds familiar, but you can't recall specific details about Volo's reputation."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: Volo is a legitimate and famous explorer whose travel guides have helped countless adventurers. His works include detailed information about various regions, though he's known for exaggerating his own role in events. He's written about Chult before and has connections throughout Faerûn. His information is generally reliable, especially when it comes to practical advice about dangers and locations. He's known to be helpful to adventurers and may even want to follow interesting parties to document their adventures."

**DC 13 Arcana Check**: Sense if Volo has magical knowledge or items

- **Success**: "You can sense that Volo has some magical knowledge, though he's not a powerful spellcaster himself. He may have magical items or connections to magical organizations. His knowledge of Chult might include information about magical dangers or locations."
- **Failure**: "You can't determine if Volo has any magical knowledge or items."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your arcane senses reveal that Volo has some magical items (likely protective charms or utility items) and connections to magical organizations. He may have learned about magical dangers in Chult from these sources. His knowledge might include information about ancient magical sites, artifacts, or the magical nature of the Death Curse."

## What Volo Says (Key Dialogue)

### Initial Greeting

"'Ah, newcomers! Volothamp Geddarm, at your service! But you can call me Volo - everyone does. Come, sit! I've been waiting for adventurers like yourselves. I have stories to tell, and information that might just save your lives in the jungle ahead.'"

---

## Essential Information Volo Must Provide

Use these "What to Say" sections to ensure Volo provides all information players need to progress. Present this information naturally through conversation, skill checks, or when players ask specific questions.

### 1. Solid Lead - Where to Go

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "I've heard rumors, mind you, just rumors, that the source of this Death Curse - this Soulmonger you're seeking - lies in what the locals call the 'old city' somewhere deep in the jungle interior. Some call it Omu - the Forbidden City. An ancient place, full of danger. But that's just what I've heard from various sources. The jungle holds many secrets, and not all of them are safe to uncover."

**Alternative Lead Option:**

> "There's also talk of an oracle ziggurat called Orolunga. Ancient, powerful, said to answer any question if you can reach it. It's located inland, following the river that flows from the mountains. If you're looking for answers about the Soulmonger, Orolunga might know. I can give you rough directions if you're interested."

**When to Say This:** After initial greeting, when players ask about the Soulmonger, or after a successful Persuasion check (DC 12)

---

### 2. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Disease

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "The jungle is no place for the unprepared. Disease is rampant - mosquitoes carry deadly diseases that can kill you in days. Contaminated water brings dysentery. Every wound risks infection. Without proper protection - insect repellent, clean water, proper hygiene - you'll be making daily saves against disease. And failure means suffering, weakness, and potentially death. Disease kills more adventurers than creatures do."

**When to Say This:** When discussing jungle dangers, after players mention preparation, or after a successful Persuasion check (DC 12)

---

### 3. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Weather and Environment

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "The weather itself can kill you. The heat alone causes exhaustion in hours. Tropical storms can destroy your supplies, ruin your gear, and force you to turn back. You'll need proper shelter, water storage that won't break, and protection from the elements. The weather changes daily, and you must be prepared for anything - extreme heat, torrential storms, or both."

**When to Say This:** When discussing jungle dangers or preparation

---

### 4. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Navigation

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "The jungle has no roads, no clear paths. Without a guide who knows the terrain, you'll get lost. I've heard stories of expeditions that got lost on the second day, wasted weeks trying to find their way, ran out of supplies, and died of exhaustion. Getting lost means wasted days, wasted supplies, and increased danger. A guide isn't optional - it's essential for survival. You cannot navigate the jungle without someone who knows its secrets."

**When to Say This:** When discussing guides or navigation

---

### 5. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Random Encounters

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "Every day in the jungle brings new dangers. Dinosaurs hunt in the undergrowth. Undead wander from the Soulmonger's influence. Hostile tribes defend their territory. Natural hazards can kill the unwary - quicksand, falling trees, flash floods. You must be ready for combat, negotiation, or flight at any moment. The jungle is alive with threats, and complacency means death."

**When to Say This:** When discussing jungle dangers or what to expect

---

### 6. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Resource Management

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "You can't carry everything. Water is heavy but essential - you'll need a gallon per person per day, more in extreme heat. Food spoils faster in the jungle. Supplies run out. When you run out of water or food, exhaustion sets in quickly. Plan carefully, ration wisely, and always know where your next meal and drink are coming from. The jungle doesn't provide - you must bring everything you need."

**When to Say This:** When discussing supplies or preparation

---

### 7. Understanding Jungle Dangers - Exhaustion

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "Exhaustion is a killer. Heat causes it. Forced marches cause it. Disease causes it. Lack of water or food causes it. And exhaustion is cumulative - it gets worse with each level. Level six exhaustion means death. Recovery is difficult in jungle conditions. You must manage your resources, pace yourself, and avoid pushing too hard. The jungle will test your endurance every single day."

**When to Say This:** When discussing survival challenges or exhaustion

---

### 8. The Importance of Guides

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "Guides are not optional in Chult - they're essential. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes, and even experienced adventurers can get lost or killed without proper guidance. Each guide has their own methods and knowledge. Some know specific regions, others have connections with tribes or factions. Choose wisely - your lives may depend on it. You can find guides through Merchant Prince Kwayothe or at the guide guild."

**When to Say This:** When discussing preparation or if players ask about guides

---

### 9. The Importance of Supplies

**What to Say (Essential):**

> "You'll need proper supplies: food rations - at least a week's worth, more if you can carry it. Water containers - a gallon per person per day, minimum. Insect repellent - this is critical, absolutely essential. Tents for shelter from weather and insects. Rain catchers for water collection. Canoes if you're traveling by river. Don't skimp on these - missing any of them could mean death. You can find everything you need in the Grand Souk."

**When to Say This:** When discussing preparation or supplies
