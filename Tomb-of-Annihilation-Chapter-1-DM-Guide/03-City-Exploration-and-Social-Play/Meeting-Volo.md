## What to Say

> "You find a bustling tavern called the Thundering Lizard (or another popular establishment). Inside, adventurers, guides, and merchants mingle over drinks and food. The air is thick with conversation, the clink of tankards, and the occasional burst of laughter or argument.
>
> In a corner, a flamboyant figure holds court. He's a middle-aged man with an elaborate mustache, wearing colorful but practical travel clothes. A quill and inkwell sit on the table before him, along with a half-finished manuscript. He's regaling a small crowd with animated tales, gesturing wildly as he speaks.
>
> 'Ah, newcomers!' he calls out as he spots you. 'Volothamp Geddarm, at your service! But you can call me Volo - everyone does. Come, sit! I've been waiting for adventurers like yourselves. I have stories to tell, and information that might just save your lives in the jungle ahead.'"

## DM Guidance

Volo is a colorful, helpful NPC who provides valuable information but tends to exaggerate. He's genuinely knowledgeable about Chult but may embellish his own accomplishments. Use him to provide essential information about jungle dangers, the importance of guides, and rumors about the Soulmonger. He can be a recurring character who may want to follow the party to write about their adventures. Make him entertaining but useful - his information should be valuable even if his delivery is flamboyant.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Observe Volo's true nature and reliability

- **Success**: "You notice that despite his flamboyant personality, Volo's equipment shows signs of genuine travel and adventure. His clothes are well-worn but practical, and you spot several small scars that suggest real danger. His enthusiasm seems genuine, though you sense he might be prone to exaggeration."
- **Failure**: "Volo seems like a friendly storyteller, but you can't determine how reliable his information might be."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you notice that Volo's equipment and bearing suggest extensive real-world experience, not just tall tales. His scars and travel-worn gear indicate genuine adventures. You can tell he's knowledgeable but likely prone to self-aggrandizement. His information will probably be useful, but you should verify the more dramatic claims."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine Volo's manuscript and research his reputation

- **Success**: "Looking at Volo's manuscript and asking around, you learn that Volothamp Geddarm is indeed a famous explorer and author. His travel guides are well-known, though they have a reputation for being both helpful and slightly exaggerated. His information about Chult is considered generally reliable, if sometimes embellished."
- **Failure**: "You can't verify much about Volo's background or reputation."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your investigation reveals detailed information: Volo is a legitimate explorer and author whose works are widely read. His information is generally reliable, though he's known for exaggerating his own role in events. He's written extensively about various regions of Faerûn and has a reputation for being helpful to adventurers. His knowledge of Chult is considered valuable, and he's known to have connections with various factions and NPCs throughout the region."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 12 Persuasion Check**: Get Volo to share useful information

- **Success**: "Volo's eyes light up at your interest. 'Ah, you want to know about Chult? Well, my friends, you've come to the right person! I've spent considerable time here, and I can tell you this: the jungle is no place for the unprepared. Disease is rampant - mosquitoes carry shivering sickness, contaminated water brings dysentery, and the heat itself can kill you. But more than that, the jungle is home to creatures that would make a dragon think twice. Dinosaurs, of course, but also things far worse. And guides? Absolutely essential. You cannot survive the jungle without someone who knows its secrets.'"
- **Failure**: "Volo seems friendly but doesn't share much beyond general pleasantries."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Volo becomes quite talkative: 'My friends, you're clearly serious adventurers! Let me tell you what I know. The jungle is deadly - disease, monsters, hostile tribes, and the environment itself will kill the unprepared. Guides are not optional - they're essential. I've heard rumors, mind you, just rumors, that the source of this Death Curse - this Soulmonger you're seeking - lies in what the locals call the "old city" somewhere deep in the jungle interior. An ancient place, full of danger. But that's just what I've heard from various sources. The jungle holds many secrets, and not all of them are safe to uncover.'"

**DC 11 Insight Check**: Detect when Volo is exaggerating

- **Success**: "You can tell that Volo is prone to exaggeration, especially when talking about his own accomplishments. However, his core information about Chult seems genuine, even if he embellishes the details. You can distinguish between his reliable knowledge and his self-aggrandizing stories."
- **Failure**: "Volo seems sincere, but you can't tell if he's exaggerating or being completely truthful."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your insight is sharp: you can clearly identify when Volo is exaggerating (usually when talking about himself) versus when he's sharing genuine knowledge (usually when discussing Chult's dangers or locations). You notice he becomes more reliable when discussing facts he's learned from others versus his own adventures. His information about the jungle, guides, and the Soulmonger seems to come from reliable sources, even if he presents it dramatically."

**DC 12 History Check**: Recall Volo's reputation and past works

- **Success**: "You remember that Volothamp Geddarm is a famous explorer and author. His travel guides are well-known throughout Faerûn, and he's written extensively about various regions. He has a reputation for being helpful to adventurers, though his accounts are sometimes exaggerated. His information is generally considered reliable, if sometimes embellished."
- **Failure**: "The name sounds familiar, but you can't recall specific details about Volo's reputation."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your historical knowledge is extensive: Volo is a legitimate and famous explorer whose travel guides have helped countless adventurers. His works include detailed information about various regions, though he's known for exaggerating his own role in events. He's written about Chult before and has connections throughout Faerûn. His information is generally reliable, especially when it comes to practical advice about dangers and locations. He's known to be helpful to adventurers and may even want to follow interesting parties to document their adventures."

**DC 13 Arcana Check**: Sense if Volo has magical knowledge or items

- **Success**: "You can sense that Volo has some magical knowledge, though he's not a powerful spellcaster himself. He may have magical items or connections to magical organizations. His knowledge of Chult might include information about magical dangers or locations."
- **Failure**: "You can't determine if Volo has any magical knowledge or items."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "Your arcane senses reveal that Volo has some magical items (likely protective charms or utility items) and connections to magical organizations. He may have learned about magical dangers in Chult from these sources. His knowledge might include information about ancient magical sites, artifacts, or the magical nature of the Death Curse."

## What Volo Says (Key Dialogue)

### Initial Greeting

"'Ah, newcomers! Volothamp Geddarm, at your service! But you can call me Volo - everyone does. Come, sit! I've been waiting for adventurers like yourselves. I have stories to tell, and information that might just save your lives in the jungle ahead.'"

### About the Jungle (DC 12 Persuasion Success)

"'The jungle is no place for the unprepared. Disease is rampant - mosquitoes carry shivering sickness, contaminated water brings dysentery, and the heat itself can kill you. But more than that, the jungle is home to creatures that would make a dragon think twice. Dinosaurs, of course, but also things far worse. And guides? Absolutely essential. You cannot survive the jungle without someone who knows its secrets.'"

### About the Soulmonger (DC 12 Persuasion Success, or if asked directly)

"'I've heard rumors, mind you, just rumors, that the source of this Death Curse - this Soulmonger you're seeking - lies in what the locals call the "old city" somewhere deep in the jungle interior. An ancient place, full of danger. But that's just what I've heard from various sources. The jungle holds many secrets, and not all of them are safe to uncover.'"

### About Guides

"'Guides are not optional in Chult - they're essential. The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes, and even experienced adventurers can get lost or killed without proper guidance. Each guide has their own methods and knowledge. Choose wisely - your lives may depend on it.'"

### About His Writing

"'I'm working on a new guide, you see. Volo's Guide to Chult - or perhaps Volo's Guide to Surviving the Death Curse. I think your adventures would make excellent material. If you're successful, I'd love to document your journey. It would be quite the story!'"
