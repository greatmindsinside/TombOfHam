## Movement and Tracking

### How the DM Handles Movement on Maps

Different maps use different movement systems. Here's how to handle movement for each map type:

#### Regional Maps (Chult Wilderness Map)

The **Players' Map of Chult** uses **hex-based movement** for wilderness travel:

**Hex Movement Rules:**

- **Normal Pace**: 1 hex per day
- **Fast Pace**: 2 hexes per day (risk of exhaustion)
- **Slow Pace**: 0.5 hexes per day (more careful, less risk)
- **Canoe Travel**: 2-3 hexes per day (when traveling on rivers)
- **Difficult Terrain**: Mountains and swamps = 0.5 hexes per day

**Tracking Movement:**

1. **Mark Starting Position**: Note which hex the party starts in (usually Port Nyanzaru)
2. **Daily Movement**: Each day, move the party token/marker based on their chosen pace
3. **Navigation Checks**: Guide makes DC 10 Survival check daily (DC 15 without guide)
   - **Success**: Party moves to intended hex
   - **Failure**: Party is lost - waste 1 day finding their way (don't move hex)
4. **Record Location**: Keep track of which hex the party is in each day
5. **Random Encounters**: Roll for encounters each day based on current hex location

**Example:** Party leaves Port Nyanzaru heading toward Camp Vengeance. Day 1: Guide succeeds on Survival check, party moves 1 hex. Day 2: Guide fails, party is lost, stays in same hex. Day 3: Guide succeeds, party moves 1 hex forward.

**Visual Tracking Tips:**

- Use tokens, pins, or markers on a physical map
- For digital maps, use map pins or drawing tools to mark party location
- Consider using a separate tracking sheet to note hex coordinates
- Update player-visible map periodically (don't reveal exact location if they're lost)

#### City Maps (Port Nyanzaru, Omu)

City maps use **standard grid movement** (typically 5-foot squares):

**Grid Movement Rules:**

- **Standard Speed**: Most characters move 30 feet per turn (6 squares on a 5-foot grid)
- **Movement in Combat**: Use standard D&D 5E movement rules (see [Combat Reference](./Combat.md))
- **Exploration Movement**: Characters can move freely through city streets
- **Distance**: Use the grid to estimate travel time between locations

**Tracking Movement:**

1. **No Formal Tracking Needed**: In cities, players describe where they want to go
2. **Use Map for Reference**: Reference the map to determine travel time and routes
3. **Combat Movement**: If combat occurs, use grid squares for precise positioning
4. **Player Visibility**: City maps can be shown to players (they're exploring, not sneaking through unknown territory)

**Example:** Party wants to go from Harbor District to Market Ward. DM references map, determines it's about 10 minutes walk through city streets. No need to track exact squares unless combat occurs.

#### Dungeon Maps (Fane, Tomb of the Nine Gods, etc.)

Dungeon maps use **standard grid movement** with **fog of war**:

**Grid Movement Rules:**

- **Standard Speed**: 30 feet per turn (6 squares on 5-foot grid)
- **Combat Movement**: Precise grid-based movement during encounters
- **Exploration Movement**: Players describe movement, DM tracks on hidden map
- **Hidden Information**: DM map shows traps, secret doors, monsters - player map does not

**Tracking Movement:**

1. **DM Keeps Hidden Map**: Use full map with all information
2. **Player Map (Optional)**: Give players blank or modified map, or use fog of war on VTT
3. **Track Party Position**: Mark where the party is on your DM map
4. **Reveal as They Explore**: As players explore, reveal areas on player map
5. **Combat Positioning**: Switch to precise grid movement when combat starts

**Example:** Party enters Fane of the Night Serpent. DM tracks their position on full map. When they enter a room, DM describes it and reveals that room on player map. When combat starts, switch to grid-based movement.

#### Location Maps (Forts, Camps, Ruins)

Location maps vary - some use grids, some are more abstract:

**Movement Rules:**

- **Grid-Based Locations**: Use standard 5-foot grid movement
- **Abstract Locations**: Use narrative movement (describe where they go)
- **Combat Areas**: Switch to grid when combat occurs

**Tracking Movement:**

1. **Determine Map Type**: Check if location uses grid or is abstract
2. **Narrative Movement**: For abstract maps, use descriptive movement
3. **Grid for Combat**: If combat occurs, use grid squares
4. **Player Visibility**: Most location maps can be partially shown to players

---

## Usage Notes

### For Dungeon Masters

1. **Hidden Information**: Most dungeon and location maps contain traps, secret doors, and monster locations. Use DM-only versions or cover hidden areas when showing maps to players.

2. **Player Handouts**: Use player-safe versions of maps when possible. Many online resources provide versions with hidden information removed.

3. **Virtual Tabletop**: For Roll20 or other VTT platforms, consider purchasing official modules or using community map packs for best results.

4. **Printing**: Mike Schley's official maps are high-resolution and suitable for printing if you play in person.

5. **Map Scale**: Be aware of map scale when describing distances to players. The Chult map uses hexes for travel, while city and dungeon maps use standard grid measurements.

6. **Movement Tracking Tools**:
   - **Physical Maps**: Use tokens, pins, or dry-erase markers
   - **Digital Maps**: Use map pins, drawing tools, or VTT tokens
   - **Separate Tracking Sheet**: Keep a simple log of party location (especially for hex travel)
   - **Player vs DM Maps**: Maintain separate maps - one for you (with all info) and one for players (revealed areas only)

7. **Hex Travel Best Practices**:
   - Track party location daily
   - Note which hex they're in at start of each session
   - Use navigation failures to create tension (being lost)
   - Consider weather and terrain when determining movement speed
   - Reference [Jungle Travel Rules](../../tomb-of-annihilation/mechanics/jungle-travel.md) for detailed mechanics

### For Players

1. **Player Maps**: The Players' Map of Chult and Players' Map of Omu are designed to be shared with players and don't contain spoilers.

2. **Travel Planning**: Use the Chult map to plan your route through the jungle, but remember that the map may not show all dangers.

3. **City Exploration**: The Omu map shows the city layout but not the dangers within each location.
