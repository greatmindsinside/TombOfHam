## Opening (5 min)

**What to Say:**

> "Rumors have reached you of a terrible curse spreading across Faerûn - the dead stay dead, and those brought back to life are withering away. Resurrection magic has failed worldwide. A desperate woman named Syndra Silvane approaches your party. She explains that she's dying from this 'Death Curse' and knows its source: a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, hidden in the jungles of Chult."

**Setup:**

- Location: Wherever the party is when Syndra approaches them

- NPC: [Syndra Silvane](./syndra-silvane-npc.md) | [Syndra Meeting](../01-Introduction-and-Hook/Syndra-Meeting.md) (dying from Death Curse)

- Mood: Urgent but hopeful

**What to Say:**

> "Before you stands a woman in her middle years, her skin pale and drawn, with dark circles under her eyes. Withered patches mark her flesh where the Death Curse has taken hold. Despite her weakened state, there's a fire in her eyes - the determination of someone who's faced death before and refused to yield.
>
> 'Adventurers,' she says, her voice hoarse but steady. 'You've heard the rumors, haven't you? The dead stay dead. Resurrection magic fails. And those of us brought back from death's door... we're withering away.'
>
> She pulls back her sleeve, revealing a withered, necrotic arm. 'This curse affects the entire world. But I know its source: a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, hidden in the jungles of Chult. I was part of an expedition that found it once... and barely escaped with our lives.'
>
> 'I offer you 5,000 gold pieces now, plus whatever magic items you need from my collection, and my eternal gratitude. I'll teleport you directly to Port Nyanzaru, the only safe city in Chult. Find the Soulmonger. Destroy it. Save us all.'
>
> She looks at each of you imploringly. 'Will you accept this quest?'"

**Key Information to Convey:**

## Scene 2: Teleportation to Port Nyanzaru (10 min)

**Transition:**

> "Syndra nods solemnly and begins an arcane ritual. She traces glowing runes in the air, and you feel a strange tugging sensation, as if reality itself is being pulled apart. The world dissolves into swirling colors and sensations...
>
> When the disorientation fades, you find yourselves standing on a stone platform overlooking a bustling harbor. The air is thick and humid, carrying the scent of salt water, exotic spices, and something reptilian. Below you, the port city of Port Nyanzaru teems with life - brightly painted buildings, crowded markets, and... dinosaurs? Massive reptiles pull wagons, race through streets, and lounge in shaded enclosures.
>
> The heat hits you like a physical force, and the sounds of the city wash over you: vendors hawking wares in multiple languages, the bellows of strange beasts, and the constant bustle of a thriving metropolis. Welcome to Chult."

---

## Scene 3: Arriving in Port Nyanzaru (30 min)

**Transition:**

> "As you take in your surroundings, Port Nyanzaru sprawls before you - a vibrant, chaotic city unlike any you've seen. The streets are a riot of color, with buildings painted in every shade imaginable: turquoise, crimson, gold, and emerald structures that seem to glow in the tropical sun. The air shimmers with heat and humidity, and the sounds of the city wash over you in waves."
