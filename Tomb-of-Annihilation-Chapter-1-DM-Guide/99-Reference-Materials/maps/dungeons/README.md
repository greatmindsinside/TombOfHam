# Dungeon Maps

This folder contains maps for dungeons, underground complexes, tombs, and similar locations.

## Usage

Dungeon maps typically contain hidden information (traps, secret doors, monster locations). Use DM-only versions during gameplay and reveal areas to players as they explore.

## Map Types

- Tombs and crypts
- Underground complexes
- Caves and caverns
- Ruined structures
- Temple complexes

## File Organization

Organize by:
- Location name
- Level or floor (if multi-level)
- Grid vs gridless versions

## Tips

- Keep DM versions separate from player versions
- Use fog of war or reveal areas gradually
- Note trap locations and secret doors on your DM copy
- Consider printing or using VTT for dynamic lighting
