## Read-Aloud Description

> "Port Nyanzaru sprawls before you—a vibrant city of colorful buildings, dinosaur-drawn carriages, and merchants from across Faerûn. The smell of spices and sea salt fills the air. Brightly painted structures in turquoise, crimson, gold, and emerald glow in the tropical sun. Dinosaurs of all sizes move through the streets—massive triceratops pulling wagons, sleek deinonychus being led by handlers, and smaller reptiles darting between the legs of merchants and sailors."
