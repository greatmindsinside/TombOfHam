## Overview

**Combat** happens when characters face hostile creatures or dangerous situations that require action. Combat is structured in rounds and turns, making it easy to track who acts when and what they can do.

**When combat starts:**

- The DM calls for initiative rolls
- Everyone acts in order based on their initiative
- Combat continues until one side is defeated, flees, or surrenders

---

## Combat Flow

### Step 1: Initiative

When combat begins, everyone rolls **Initiative**:

1. Roll a **d20** and add your **Dexterity modifier**
2. The DM records everyone's initiative (players and enemies)
3. Everyone acts in order from **highest to lowest** initiative
4. Ties go to the player (or DM decides)

**Example:** Alice rolls 18, Bob rolls 12, Goblin rolls 15. Order: Alice (18) → Goblin (15) → Bob (12)

### Step 2: Rounds and Turns

- **Round**: One complete cycle where everyone takes their turn
- **Turn**: Your individual action during a round
- Combat continues round after round until it ends

### Step 3: Your Turn Structure

On your turn, you can do the following **in any order**:

1. **Move** - Move up to your speed (usually 30 feet)
2. **Action** - Take one action (attack, cast spell, etc.)
3. **Bonus Action** - If you have one available (some abilities grant this)
4. **Free Interaction** - One small interaction with an object (draw weapon, open door)

**You can also:**

- **Reaction** - Use anytime during the round when triggered (not just on your turn)

## Actions in Combat

### Attack

Make a melee or ranged weapon attack:

1. **Roll d20** + your attack modifier (Strength for melee, Dexterity for ranged/finesse)
2. **Compare to target's AC** (Armor Class)
3. **If you meet or beat AC**: Roll damage dice
4. **If you miss**: No damage

**Example:** You roll 15, add +5 (Strength + proficiency) = 20 total. Target has AC 17. You hit! Roll damage.

### Cast a Spell

Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action:

- **Spell Attack**: Roll d20 + spellcasting modifier vs target's AC
- **Saving Throw**: Target rolls a saving throw against your spell save DC
- **Instant Effect**: Some spells just work (like healing)

### Dash

**Action**: Move up to double your speed this turn.

**Use when:** You need to reach a target or escape quickly.

### Disengage

**Action**: Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks this turn.

**Use when:** You want to move away from an enemy without being attacked.

### Dodge

**Action**: Until your next turn, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.

**Use when:** You're in danger and want to be harder to hit.

### Help

**Action**: Give an ally advantage on their next attack roll or ability check against a target within 5 feet.

**Use when:** You want to assist an ally's action.

### Hide

**Action**: Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide. If successful, you're hidden until discovered.

**Use when:** You want to attack from stealth or avoid being targeted.

### Ready

**Action**: Prepare to take a specific action when a trigger occurs. You use your reaction when the trigger happens.

**Use when:** You want to wait for a specific moment to act.

### Search

**Action**: Make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find something.

**Use when:** Looking for hidden enemies, traps, or clues.

### Use an Object

**Action**: Interact with an object (drink potion, activate magic item, etc.).

**Use when:** Using items during combat.

## Combat Mechanics

### Attack Rolls

**Formula:** d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)

- **Melee weapons**: Usually use Strength
- **Ranged weapons**: Use Dexterity
- **Finesse weapons**: Can use Strength OR Dexterity (your choice)
- **Spell attacks**: Use your spellcasting ability modifier

**To hit:** Your total must meet or exceed the target's **AC (Armor Class)**

### Damage Rolls

When you hit, roll the weapon's or spell's damage dice and add your ability modifier:

- **Melee weapons**: Add Strength modifier (or Dexterity for finesse)
- **Ranged weapons**: Add Dexterity modifier
- **Spells**: Usually add nothing (damage is set by the spell)

**Example:** Longsword deals 1d8 damage. You roll 5, add +3 Strength = 8 total damage.

### Hit Points (HP)

- **Current HP**: How much damage you can take before falling unconscious
- **Maximum HP**: Your full health (determined by class and Constitution)
- **0 HP**: You fall unconscious and start making death saving throws
- **Negative HP equal to max HP**: You die instantly

### Death Saving Throws

When you drop to 0 HP:

- Roll a **d20** at the start of each turn
- **10 or higher**: Success (mark 1 success)
- **9 or lower**: Failure (mark 1 failure)
- **3 successes**: You stabilize (stop dying, but remain unconscious)
- **3 failures**: You die
- **Natural 20**: You regain 1 HP and are conscious
- **Natural 1**: Counts as 2 failures

**Healing:** Any healing brings you back to consciousness.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

- **Advantage**: Roll 2d20, take the higher result
- **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, take the lower result
- **Both cancel out**: If you have both, roll normally (1d20)

**Common sources:**

- Advantage: Attacking from stealth, help action, certain spells
- Disadvantage: Attacking at long range, being blinded, certain conditions

---

## Movement

### Speed

- Most characters have **30 feet** of movement per turn
- You can split your movement before and after your action
- Moving through difficult terrain costs **double** (each foot counts as 2)

### Opportunity Attacks

When you **leave an enemy's reach** (usually 5 feet), they can make one melee attack against you as a **reaction**.

**To avoid:** Use the **Disengage** action, or move without leaving their reach.

**Example:** You're next to a goblin. If you move away, the goblin can attack you. If you use Disengage first, you can move safely.

### Cover

Cover provides protection from attacks:

- **Half Cover** (+2 AC): Behind a low wall, tree, or ally
- **Three-Quarters Cover** (+5 AC): Behind a window, arrow slit
- **Full Cover**: Completely blocked (can't be targeted)

**Example:** You're behind a tree. Ranged attacks against you have +2 to your AC (harder to hit).

## Spells in Combat

- **1 Bonus Action**: Quick spells (you can still take an action)
- **Reaction**: Spells like Shield or Counterspell

### Concentration

Some spells require **concentration** to maintain:

- You can only concentrate on **one spell** at a time
- If you cast another concentration spell, the first ends
- If you take damage, make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC 10 or half damage, whichever is higher)
- **Failure**: The spell ends
- **Common concentration spells**: Bless, Haste, Invisibility

### Spell Attacks vs Saving Throws

- **Spell Attack**: You roll to hit (like a weapon attack) vs target's AC
- **Saving Throw**: Target rolls to resist vs your spell save DC
- **No roll needed**: Some spells just work (like Cure Wounds)
