# Death Curse Rules

*Official source: **p. 5** (Story Overview & Death Curse rules)*

**Back to:** [Chapter 1 Home](../README.md) | [Story Setup](../01-Introduction-and-Hook/Story-Setup.md)

---

## Overview

The Death Curse is the central mechanic of Tomb of Annihilation. It prevents resurrection and slowly kills those who have been resurrected.

---

## Core Rules

### Resurrection Failure

- **All resurrection magic fails** - Raise Dead, Resurrection, True Resurrection, and Revivify all fail automatically

- **No exceptions** - Even wish spells cannot bypass this

- **Souls cannot return** - Souls are being intercepted before reaching their proper afterlife

### Affected Creatures

- **Anyone previously resurrected** is now slowly dying

- **Wasting disease** - Affected creatures lose 1 hit point maximum per day

- **No cure** - The curse cannot be removed until the Soulmonger is destroyed

- **Death is permanent** - Once an affected creature dies, they cannot be brought back

---

## Gameplay Impact

### For Players

- **Death is permanent** - If a PC dies, they cannot be resurrected

- **No safety net** - Players must be more careful

- **Urgency** - The quest has real time pressure

### For NPCs

- **Syndra Silvane** is dying (has weeks, not months)

- **Other NPCs** who have been resurrected are also affected

- **Worldwide impact** - The curse affects all of Faerûn

---

## Ending the Curse

The Death Curse ends when:

1. The **Soulmonger** is destroyed

2. This happens in the [Tomb of the Nine Gods](../locations/tomb-of-nine-gods.md)

3. Once destroyed, resurrection magic works again

4. Affected creatures stop losing hit points (but don't recover lost maximum)

---

## Player Knowledge

**What players know:**

- Resurrection magic has failed worldwide
- Those previously resurrected are dying
- The source is in Chult
- They need to find and destroy it

**What players don't know:**

- The exact location (Omu)
- The artifact's name (Soulmonger)
- The full extent of the threat
- Acererak's involvement

---

## DM Notes

- **Emphasize the stakes** - Make death feel real and permanent

- **Show the impact** - Have NPCs affected by the curse

- **Build urgency** - Syndra's condition worsens over time

- **No exceptions** - Don't allow resurrection even for dramatic moments
