## Overview

This fast-track version condenses Chapter 2 into essential elements:

1. **Travel Mechanics** - Simplified hex crawling and navigation
2. **Key Locations** - Major destinations and their purposes
3. **Random Encounters** - Condensed encounter table
4. **Weather & Disease** - Essential survival mechanics

---

## Travel Mechanics (Simplified)

### Basic Hex Crawling

- **Travel Speed**: 1 hex per day (normal pace), 2 hexes per day (fast pace with exhaustion risk)
- **Navigation**: Guide makes DC 10 Survival check daily. Failure = lost (waste 1 day finding way)
- **Rest**: Long rest requires safe location (camp, ruins, friendly settlement)

### Quick Travel Rules

- **Rivers**: Canoes allow faster travel (2-3 hexes per day)
- **Difficult Terrain**: Mountains, swamps slow travel (0.5 hexes per day)
- **Lost**: If navigation fails, roll 1d6: 1-3 = waste 1 day, 4-6 = waste 2 days

### Resource Management

- **Water**: 1 gallon per person per day (critical in heat)
- **Food**: 1 ration per person per day
- **Disease**: Daily saves vs. disease (see Disease section)
- **Exhaustion**: Risk from heat, forced march, or disease

---

## Scene 1: First Day in the Jungle

### What to Say

> "The jungle closes around you like a living wall. The sounds of Port Nyanzaru fade, replaced by the constant drone of insects, the calls of unseen creatures, and the rustle of vegetation. The heat is oppressive, the humidity clings to your skin, and every step requires effort as you push through dense undergrowth.
>
> Your guide leads the way, machete in hand, clearing a path. 'Stay alert,' they warn. 'The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Watch for tracks, listen for danger, and never stray from the group.'"

### Quick Skill Checks

- **DC 12 Survival**: Notice signs of danger (predator tracks, poisonous plants, unstable ground)
- **DC 10 Constitution Save**: Resist heat exhaustion on first day
- **DC 13 Perception**: Spot something interesting (ruins, tracks, water source)

### First Encounter (Choose One)

1. **Wildlife**: Dinosaur encounter (herbivore = avoidable, carnivore = combat)
2. **Weather**: Sudden tropical storm (shelter needed, supplies at risk)
3. **Discovery**: Old trail or ruins (potential location to explore)
4. **Disease**: First disease check (mosquitoes, contaminated water)

---
