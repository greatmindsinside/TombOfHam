## Scene 1: The Hook

**Location:** Wherever the party begins (tavern, meeting hall, or other starting location)

### What to Say

> "Rumors have reached you of a terrible curse spreading across Faerûn: the dead remain dead, and those who were once restored to life are now wasting away. Resurrection magic no longer works anywhere in the world. Amid this crisis, a gaunt, determined woman named Syndra Silvane seeks you out. She reveals she is dying from this 'Death Curse'—and that she has discovered its source: a powerful necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, hidden deep within the jungles of Chult.
>
> She offers you 5,000 gold pieces now, plus whatever magic items you need from her collection, and her eternal gratitude. She'll teleport you directly to Port Nyanzaru, the only safe city in Chult. Find the Soulmonger. Destroy it. Save us all.
>
> Her voice trembles with exhaustion and hope as she locks eyes with you. "Please... I am dying. The curse is spreading, and I do not have much time. Will you help me? Will you try to save us all?"

### Quick Interaction

- **If players ask questions**: Syndra briefly explains Chult is dangerous, the Soulmonger is in the jungle interior, and Port Nyanzaru is the only safe city. She has contacts there who can help.
- **If players negotiate**: DC 13 Persuasion - Success: +2,500 gold or one additional magic item. Failure: Standard offer stands.
- **If players hesitate**: Emphasize urgency - "Every day we delay, more people die. I have weeks, not months."

**Transition**: Once accepted, Syndra performs the teleportation ritual immediately.

## Scene 2: Arrival in Port Nyanzaru

**Location:** Teleportation Platform, Port Nyanzaru Harbor

### Arrival Description

> "Reality twists and blurs, colors swirl, and the familiar world dissolves into a maelstrom of magical energy. When it coalesces, you find yourselves standing on a stone platform overlooking a bustling harbor.
>
> The port of Port Nyanzaru is a riot of color and activity. Brightly painted buildings in every hue line the waterfront - turquoise, crimson, gold, and emerald structures that seem to glow in the tropical sun. The air shimmers with heat and humidity, carrying the mingled scents of salt water, exotic spices, and something earthy and reptilian.
>
> Massive dinosaurs lumber through the streets, some pulling heavily laden wagons, others bearing riders in elaborate saddles. Smaller reptiles dart between the legs of merchants and sailors. The docks themselves are a cacophony of sound: vendors shouting in multiple languages, the creak of ropes and timbers, the splash of waves against hulls, and the occasional bellow or chirp from the beasts of burden.
>
> The city feels alive, thriving, and utterly alien compared to the temperate ports of the Sword Coast. This is clearly a place where wealth and danger walk hand in hand."

### Quick Skill Checks (Optional)

- **DC 10 Constitution Save**: Resist teleportation sickness. Failure: Disadvantage on first check in Port Nyanzaru.
- **DC 12 Perception**: Notice guide recruiters approaching. Success: You spot several people with maps and equipment lists looking for clients.

The jungle looms ahead - a vast, green wall of vegetation that seems to swallow the horizon. Strange calls echo from the canopy, and the air grows heavier with humidity and the scent of decay.
>
> Your guide pauses at the edge of the trail. 'This is where civilization ends,' they say grimly. 'Stay close, watch your step, and remember: everything in the jungle wants to eat you.'
>
> With that sobering thought, you step into the Land of Chult..."

## Fast-Track Tips

### Pacing

- **Scene 1 (Hook)**: 10-15 minutes
- **Scene 2 (Arrival)**: 5 minutes

- **Scene 4 (Guide)**: 10 minutes
- **Scene 5 (Gear)**: 10-15 minutes
- **Scene 6 (Departure)**: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~60-75 minutes

### What to Skip

- Multiple side quests (maybe one if time allows)
- Extensive NPC interactions (keep to 1-2 key NPCs)
- Political intrigue (save for later if needed)
