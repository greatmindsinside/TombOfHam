Use **Mage** stat block from [Monster Stats](../reference/monster-stats.md#mage)

**Note:** Syndra is dying and weak, so reduce her HP by half and give her disadvantage on all checks due to the Death Curse.

## Dialogue Examples

**Initial Meeting:**

> "I'm dying, you see. The Death Curse is consuming me, as it consumes all who have been brought back from death. But I know where its source lies—in the jungles of Chult. I need brave adventurers to find it and destroy it."

**If Players Ask About Payment:**

> "I offer you 5,000 gold pieces now, plus whatever magic items you need from my collection, and my eternal gratitude. I'll teleport you directly to Port Nyanzaru, the only safe city in Chult. But more than gold, you'll be saving countless lives—including my own."

**If Players Hesitate:**

> "Every day we delay, more people die. The curse spreads, and those like me—those who have been resurrected—waste away. Please, I beg you. Help me. Help us all."
