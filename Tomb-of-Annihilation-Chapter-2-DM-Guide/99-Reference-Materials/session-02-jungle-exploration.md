- Mood: Tense, dangerous, mysterious

**What to Say:**

> "The jungle closes around you like a living wall. The sounds of the city fade, replaced by the constant drone of insects, the calls of unseen creatures, and the rustle of vegetation. The heat is oppressive, the humidity clings to your skin, and every step requires effort as you push through dense undergrowth."
