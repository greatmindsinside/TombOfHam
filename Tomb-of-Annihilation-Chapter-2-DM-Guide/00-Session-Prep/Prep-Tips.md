## Practical DM Takeaway

Chapter 2 functions as a **Wilderness Survival + Exploration** phase where players:

- Experience the dangers of jungle travel
- Navigate using hex-crawl mechanics
- Manage resources (food, water, supplies)
- Encounter random dangers and discoveries
- Visit key locations that provide information
- Learn the Soulmonger's location (Omu)

**Transition**: Move to Chapter 3 when players learn Omu's location and decide to travel there.

## Prep Tips

- Prepare the hex map and understand travel mechanics
- Decide which key locations to emphasize based on player goals
- Prepare 2-3 random encounters per travel day
- Track weather, disease, and resource consumption
- Seed information about Omu through multiple sources
- Use encounters to advance plot, not just random combat

## Alternative Chapter Structures

### Fast-Track Version

- Simplified travel: summarize days, focus on key locations
- Streamlined encounters: 1-2 per travel day, plot-relevant

- Quick resource management: abstract supplies

### Full Exploration Version

- Detailed hex-by-hex travel with full encounter tables
- All locations available for exploration
- Complete survival simulation with detailed tracking
- Extensive random encounters and discoveries

### Location-Focused Version

- Emphasize key locations over travel
- Fast travel between locations with brief summaries
- Focus on location interactions and information gathering
- Use travel primarily as transition between locations
