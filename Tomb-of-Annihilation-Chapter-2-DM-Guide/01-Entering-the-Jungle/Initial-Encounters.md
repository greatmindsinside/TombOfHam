## Encounter 1: First Dinosaur Sighting

**Location:** Jungle Trail, First Day

### Encounter 1 Setup

Players encounter a dinosaur early in their first day - this establishes the exotic nature of Chult and the potential dangers. The primary creature is a **Triceratops** (herbivore, non-aggressive unless threatened). If players are reckless or fail stealth checks, they may attract a **Velociraptor** pack (2-3 raptors).

### What to Say

> "As you push through the undergrowth, your guide suddenly stops and raises a hand for silence. Ahead, through a break in the trees, you see a massive creature - a triceratops, easily 20 feet long, grazing peacefully on vegetation. Its three horns gleam in the filtered sunlight, and its massive frill is covered in intricate patterns. The dinosaur is magnificent and terrifying in equal measure.
>
> 'That's a herbivore,' your guide whispers. 'They're usually not aggressive unless threatened. But where there are herbivores, there are predators. Stay quiet, and we'll go around. This is why we move carefully - the jungle is full of creatures that could kill us without even trying.'"

**If Players Fail Stealth or Are Reckless:**

> "The triceratops raises its head, nostrils flaring. It lets out a low, rumbling warning - a sound that seems to vibrate through your chest. From the trees behind you, you hear answering calls - sharp, bird-like shrieks. Your guide's face pales. 'Raptors. They heard the commotion. We need to move - now!'"

### Encounter 1 Creatures

#### Triceratops (Herbivore - Non-Aggressive)

**Brief Stat Block:**

- **AC:** 13 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 95 (10d12 + 30)

- **Challenge:** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Actions:**

- **Gore:** +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Stomp:** +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Behavior:** Will only attack if directly threatened or if players approach within 30 feet aggressively. Otherwise, it will continue grazing and ignore the party.

#### Velociraptor Pack (If Attracted - 2-3 Raptors)

**Brief Stat Block:**

- **AC:** 13 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 10 (3d6)
- **Speed:** 30 ft.
- **STR:** 6 (-2), **DEX:** 14 (+2), **CON:** 13 (+1), **INT:** 4 (-3), **WIS:** 12 (+1), **CHA:** 6 (-2)
- **Senses:** Passive Perception 11
- **Challenge:** 1/4 (50 XP each)

**Actions:**

- **Multiattack:** Makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its talons.

**Pack Tactics:** Raptors have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the raptor's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Behavior:** Raptors are opportunistic hunters. They will attack if players are isolated or appear weak. If the party shows strength (kills one raptor or deals significant damage), the remaining raptors will flee.

### Encounter 1 Options

1. **Follow guide's advice** - Go around quietly (safest option, avoids combat)
2. **Observe the dinosaur** - Use Perception/Nature to learn about it (DC 13 Nature reveals it's a herbivore, non-aggressive)
3. **Approach cautiously** - Try to get closer (risky - DC 12 Stealth or triceratops becomes alert)
4. **Attack or provoke** - Triggers defensive response from triceratops and may attract raptors

### Encounter 1 Skill Checks

- **DC 12 Stealth**: Pass by without alerting the dinosaur
- **DC 13 Nature**: Identify the dinosaur and its behavior patterns (herbivore, defensive when threatened)
- **DC 11 Survival**: Find the safest route around (avoids both triceratops and potential raptor territory)
- **DC 10 Perception**: Notice if predators are nearby (spots raptor tracks or hears distant calls)

### Encounter 1 Rewards

**If Players Avoid Combat:**

- Understanding that dinosaurs are common, and the importance of caution
- No resources lost
- Guide's respect increases (may provide bonus information later)

**If Combat Occurs and Players Win:**

- **Triceratops:** No valuable parts (too large to harvest quickly, guide advises against it)

  - 1d4 raptor talons (worth 5 gp each to collectors in Port Nyanzaru)
  - 1d4 raptor teeth (worth 2 gp each)
  - Raptor hide (worth 10 gp if properly preserved)

**If Players Defeat Raptors Without Killing Triceratops:**

- Guide is impressed: "You handled that well. Most newcomers panic and get themselves killed. You might survive this jungle after all."

### Encounter 1 Consequences

**If Players Alert Triceratops:**

- Triceratops charges (if within 30 feet) - 24 piercing damage, may knock prone
- Noise attracts 2-3 velociraptors (arrive in 1d4 rounds)
- Guide may take 1d4 damage from trampling if party doesn't protect them

**If Players Fight Raptors:**

- Each raptor deals average 12 damage per round if both attacks hit
- Raptors focus on isolated targets (pack tactics)
- If party kills 1+ raptor, others flee
- Combat takes 2-3 rounds typically

**If Players Are Reckless:**

- May attract additional predators (roll on random encounter table)
- Guide loses trust (may charge more or refuse dangerous routes later)
- Party wastes time and resources

## Encounter 2: First Weather Challenge

**Location:** Jungle Trail, First Day

### Encounter 2 Setup

A sudden tropical storm hits during the first day, teaching players about weather dangers. This is an **environmental encounter** - no combat, but significant resource and time management challenges.

### What to Say (Encounter 2)

**Initial Warning (5 minutes before storm):**

> "The sky darkens rapidly, and the air grows heavy with moisture. Your guide looks up, concern evident. 'Storm coming. We need to find shelter - now. These storms can last for hours, and getting caught in one means soaked supplies, lost time, and increased disease risk. Look for overhanging rocks, dense tree cover, or any structure that can keep us dry.'"

**As Storm Begins:**

> "The first drops of rain begin to fall, heavy and warm. Within minutes, it's a torrential downpour. The rain comes in sheets, reducing visibility to just 30 feet. The ground beneath your feet turns to mud, making every step treacherous. Lightning flashes overhead, followed by thunder that shakes the very air. You're forced to seek cover immediately."

**If Players Find Shelter:**

> "You manage to find [shelter type] just as the full force of the storm hits. The rain pounds against your shelter, but you're relatively dry. Your guide breathes a sigh of relief. 'Good thinking. This storm will pass in an hour or two, but being caught in it would have ruined half our supplies.'"

**If Players Don't Find Shelter:**

> "The storm hits with full force before you can find adequate shelter. The rain soaks through everything - your clothes, your packs, your supplies. The mud makes movement difficult, and you're forced to huddle under whatever cover you can find. Your guide looks grim. 'This is going to cost us. Some of our food will spoil, and wet gear is heavy gear.'"

### Encounter 2 Environmental Details

**Storm Duration:** 1d4 + 1 hours (2-5 hours)

**Storm Effects:**

## Encounter 3: First Disease Check

**Location:** Jungle Trail, First Day

### Encounter 3 Setup

Players encounter mosquitoes or contaminated water, triggering their first disease check. This encounter features a **Swarm of Insects (Mosquitoes)** if players don't use repellent, and potentially contaminated water sources.

### What to Say (Encounter 3)

**Mosquito Swarm Approach:**

> "As you travel, the air grows thick with mosquitoes. They swarm around you, drawn by your body heat and the carbon dioxide you exhale. The buzzing is constant and maddening. Your guide immediately applies insect repellent and urges you to do the same, their voice urgent.
>
> 'These aren't just annoying - they carry disease. Shivering sickness, malaria, worse. Without protection, you'll be making saves every day. And even with protection, you need to be careful around water sources. Most jungle water is contaminated.'"

**If Players Don't Use Repellent:**

> "The mosquitoes swarm closer, landing on exposed skin. You feel dozens of tiny pinpricks as they bite. Your guide looks alarmed. 'You need repellent - now! Every bite is a chance at disease. Apply it before they get worse!'"

**If Players Find Water Source:**

> "You come across a small stream cutting through the jungle. The water looks clear, but your guide shakes their head. 'Don't drink that. Looks can be deceiving. Most water in Chult carries parasites or disease. You need to boil it first, or use purification methods. Drinking straight from the source is asking for trouble.'"

### Encounter 3 Creatures

#### Swarm of Insects (Mosquitoes)

**Brief Stat Block:**

- **AC:** 12 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 22 (5d8)
- **Speed:** 20 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 40 ft.
- **STR:** 3 (-4), **DEX:** 13 (+1), **CON:** 10 (+0), **INT:** 1 (-5), **WIS:** 7 (-2), **CHA:** 1 (-5)
- **Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Prone, Restrained, Stunned

- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease (see below).

**Swarm Traits:**

- The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa
- The swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect
- The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points

**Disease (Shivering Sickness):**

- **Saving Throw:** DC 11 Constitution
- **Onset:** 1d4 hours
- **Effect:** The target's speed is halved, and at the end of each long rest, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10). The disease is cured if the target receives magical healing or if someone successfully treats the disease with a DC 12 Medicine check (takes 1 hour).

**Behavior:** The swarm attacks any creature that enters its space without insect repellent. If repellent is applied, the swarm avoids that creature for 8 hours. The swarm disperses if reduced to 0 hit points or if all targets have repellent.

### Encounter 3 Environmental Details

**Water Contamination:**

- **Contaminated Water Sources:** Most streams, pools, and standing water in Chult
- **Disease Risk:** DC 12 Constitution save or contract a disease (same as mosquito bite)

- **Without Repellent:** Swarm appears and attacks
- **With Repellent:** Swarm avoids party (no attack)
- **Partial Protection:** If only some party members have repellent, swarm focuses on unprotected members

### Encounter 3 Options

2. **Check water sources** - Use Survival/Nature to find safe water (DC 11 Survival or DC 13 Nature)
3. **Use skill checks** - Medicine to understand disease risks, Survival to avoid exposure
4. **Ask guide for advice** - Learn about disease prevention (guide explains mechanics)
5. **Fight the swarm** - Attack mosquitoes directly (not recommended - better to use repellent)

### Encounter 3 Skill Checks

- **DC 10 Constitution Save**: Resist disease if exposed (required if bitten or drink contaminated water)
- **DC 12 Medicine**: Understand disease risks and prevention (gives advantage on future disease saves)
- **DC 11 Survival**: Find safe water sources (identifies which water can be purified)
- **DC 13 Nature**: Identify contaminated vs. safe water (knows which sources are definitely unsafe)
- **DC 12 Medicine (Treatment)**: Treat disease if contracted (requires 1 hour, cures disease)

## Encounter 4: Discovery - Old Trail or Ruins

**Location:** Jungle Trail, First Day

5-6: **Abandoned Expedition Site** (recent explorers, may have useful supplies)

### What to Say (Encounter 4)

**Initial Discovery:**

> "Your guide pauses, examining something on the ground. 'Old trail markers,' they say. 'Someone came through here before - maybe weeks ago, maybe months. The jungle reclaims everything quickly, but these markers are still visible if you know what to look for.'
>
> Ahead, through the trees, you catch a glimpse of weathered stone - the remains of some ancient structure, mostly reclaimed by the jungle. 'Ruins,' your guide continues. 'Chult is full of them. Most are dangerous, but some contain valuable information or treasure. This one looks small - probably not worth exploring, but it's a reminder that this land has a long history.'"

**If Players Examine Closely (DC 13 Investigation):**

> "As you examine the site more carefully, you notice [discovery based on roll]. The [trail markers/ruins/camp] tell a story - [specific details based on what was found]. Your guide looks thoughtful. 'This could be useful, or it could be a trap. The jungle doesn't give up its secrets easily.'"

**If Ruins Are Occupied (DC 13 Perception):**

> "Your guide suddenly goes still, hand raised. 'Wait. Do you hear that?' From within the ruins, you catch the sound of [scraping/dragging/moaning]. Something is moving in there. Your guide's expression is grim. 'Undead. This place isn't abandoned - it's occupied. We should leave, unless you're looking for a fight.'"
