# First Day in the Jungle

**Location:** Jungle Edge, Just Outside Port Nyanzaru

## What to Say

> "The jungle closes around you like a living wall. The sounds of Port Nyanzaru fade behind you, replaced by the constant drone of insects, the calls of unseen creatures, and the rustle of vegetation. The heat is oppressive - even more intense than in the city - and the humidity clings to your skin like a wet blanket. Every step requires effort as you push through dense undergrowth, your boots sinking into soft earth and tangled roots.
>
> Your guide leads the way, machete in hand, methodically clearing a path. They pause frequently, checking the sun's position, examining tracks, and listening carefully. 'Stay alert,' they warn without looking back. 'The jungle doesn't forgive mistakes. Watch for tracks, listen for danger, and never stray from the group. We're not in the city anymore - out here, everything wants to eat you.'"

## What Players Experience

- The immediate transition from civilization to wilderness
- The oppressive heat and humidity
- The constant sounds of the jungle
- The guide's expertise and warnings
- The sense of entering truly dangerous territory
- The realization that they're now dependent on their guide and supplies

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Follow the guide closely** - Trust the guide's expertise and stay with the group
2. **Observe the environment** - Use Perception/Nature to identify dangers and features
3. **Help with navigation** - Use Survival to assist the guide
4. **Ask questions** - Inquire about dangers, destination, or travel plans
5. **Take precautions** - Apply insect repellent, check supplies, prepare for dangers
6. **Explore cautiously** - Look for interesting features while staying safe

## DM Guidance

This is the first real taste of wilderness danger. Emphasize the transition from safe city to dangerous jungle. Let the guide take the lead in descriptions initially. Use skill checks to help players orient themselves. This first day sets the tone for the entire chapter - dangerous, mysterious, and requiring constant vigilance. Don't overwhelm players, but make it clear the jungle is a threat.

## Skill Checks

### Perception/Investigation Checks

**DC 12 Perception Check**: Notice immediate dangers or interesting features

- **Success**: "You spot several things of note: large tracks that suggest a predator passed through recently, a cluster of brightly colored but suspicious-looking plants that your guide carefully avoids, and the distant sound of something large moving through the undergrowth. The jungle is clearly full of dangers, but your guide seems to know how to avoid most of them."
- **Failure**: "The jungle is a confusing mass of vegetation, sounds, and movement. You can't distinguish what's dangerous from what's harmless."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your observation is keen: you identify specific predator tracks (possibly a large carnivorous dinosaur), recognize poisonous plants that your guide is avoiding, spot a safe water source ahead, and notice signs of recent humanoid activity (possibly other explorers). You also notice your guide is following a subtle trail that's not immediately obvious."

**DC 13 Investigation Check**: Examine the trail and understand navigation methods

- **Success**: "You notice your guide is following subtle markers - notched trees, small rock cairns, and natural landmarks. They're clearly following a known route, though the path isn't obvious to an untrained eye. The guide checks these markers frequently and adjusts course accordingly."
- **Failure**: "The guide seems to know where they're going, but you can't determine their navigation method."
- **Critical Success (18+)**: "You understand the navigation system: your guide is following a network of subtle trail markers that form a known route through this part of the jungle. The markers are old but maintained, suggesting this path has been used by guides for some time. You can now identify these markers yourself, which could be useful if the guide is incapacitated."

### Additional Skill Checks

**DC 10 Constitution Save**: Resist heat exhaustion on first day

- **Success**: "Despite the oppressive heat, you manage to keep your energy up and avoid exhaustion."
- **Failure**: "The heat is overwhelming. You gain one level of exhaustion. The guide notices and suggests taking more frequent breaks."
- **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: "The heat hits you hard. You gain two levels of exhaustion and must rest immediately. The guide is concerned - this is a bad sign for your ability to handle jungle travel."

**DC 12 Survival Check**: Identify safe features and dangers

- **Success**: "Your survival knowledge helps you identify safe water sources, recognize dangerous plants and animals, and understand basic jungle navigation. You can contribute meaningfully to the journey."
- **Failure**: "The jungle is too alien - your survival knowledge from other environments doesn't fully apply here."
- **Critical Success (17+)**: "Your survival expertise is valuable: you can identify multiple safe water sources, recognize all dangerous flora and fauna, understand the guide's navigation methods, and even suggest alternative routes or shortcuts. The guide appreciates your knowledge."

**DC 11 Nature Check**: Understand the jungle ecosystem

- **Success**: "You recognize the jungle's ecosystem: the dense vegetation provides cover for predators, the constant moisture supports disease-carrying insects, and the heat creates dangerous conditions. You understand why the guide moves carefully and avoids certain areas."
- **Failure**: "The jungle ecosystem is too complex and alien to understand quickly."
- **Critical Success (16+)**: "Your nature knowledge reveals detailed information: you can identify the specific types of dangerous plants and animals, understand predator-prey relationships, recognize signs of recent animal activity, and even predict where certain dangers might be found. This knowledge helps you avoid threats and identify opportunities."
