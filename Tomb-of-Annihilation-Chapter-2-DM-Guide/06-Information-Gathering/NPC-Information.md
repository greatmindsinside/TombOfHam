## Information Sources by Location

### Fort Beluarian (Flaming Fist)

**Location:** Fort Beluarian

**NPCs:** Commander Liara Portyr, Flaming Fist soldiers

**What to Say:**

> "Commander Portyr studies you carefully. 'You're looking for the source of the Death Curse? We've been tracking undead activity for weeks. They're all moving in one direction - toward what our maps call Omu. It's marked as a lost city, but the undead don't lie. If they're all heading there, that's where your artifact must be. I can show you on a map, but the journey will be dangerous. The closer you get to Omu, the more undead you'll face.'"

**Information Quality:** Good - military intelligence, maps, undead tracking

**Information Provided:**

- Undead movement patterns point to Omu

### Camp Vengeance (Order of the Gauntlet)

**Location:** Camp Vengeance

**NPCs:** Commander Breakbone, Order members

**What to Say:**

> "Commander Breakbone, exhausted from constant fighting, looks at you with grim determination. 'The undead keep coming. They're drawn to something - a powerful necromantic source. We've lost scouts trying to track them, but they all report the same thing: the undead are heading toward Omu, the Forbidden City. It's a legend, but legends have truth. If the Soulmonger is anywhere, it's there. But getting there means fighting through hordes of undead. Are you prepared for that?'"

**Information Quality:** Good - firsthand experience with undead, religious knowledge

**Information Provided:**

- Undead are drawn to a necromantic source (Soulmonger)

### Kir Sabal (Aarakocra)

**Location:** Kir Sabal

**NPCs:** Princess Mwaxanare, Asharra

**What to Say:**

It was once the greatest city in Chult, home to the gods themselves. But it fell, consumed by darkness. Now, something powerful draws the undead there. From the air, we can see them - all moving toward the same place. If you seek the source of the Death Curse, that is where you must go. But beware - the city is protected by ancient magic, and those who enter rarely return.'"

Our [scouts/reports/observations] confirm it: they're heading toward Omu, the Forbidden City. It's deep in the jungle, hidden, protected. If the Soulmonger is anywhere, that's where it is.
