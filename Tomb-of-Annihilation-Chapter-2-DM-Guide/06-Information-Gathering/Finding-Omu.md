**Location:** Various (Information Sources Throughout Jungle)

## Overview

Players must learn that the Soulmonger is located in Omu, the lost city. This information can come from multiple sources: the oracle at Orolunga, NPCs at various locations, clues in ruins, or following undead activity.

## Primary Information Sources

### 1. Orolunga Oracle (Most Direct)

**Location:** Orolunga Ziggurat

**What to Say:**

> "The oracle's voice echoes with ancient wisdom. 'You seek the source of the Death Curse - the Soulmonger. It lies in Omu, the Forbidden City, deep in the jungle interior. The city is lost, hidden, protected by ancient magic. To reach it, you must follow the signs: where the undead gather, where the land itself rejects life, where the old gods' power still lingers. The path is dangerous, but the destination is clear. Omu awaits those brave enough to seek it.'"

**Information Provided:**

- Omu is the location of the Soulmonger
- Omu is a lost/forbidden city
- Undead activity points toward Omu
- The city is protected by ancient magic
- The journey is extremely dangerous

### 2. NPCs at Key Locations

**Location:** Fort Beluarian, Camp Vengeance, Kir Sabal, etc.

**What to Say:**

> "[NPC name] looks thoughtful. 'The Soulmonger? We've seen the undead - they all move in the same direction, deeper into the jungle. Our scouts report they're heading toward what the old maps call Omu - the Forbidden City. It's a legend, really. Most think it's a myth, but the undead don't lie. If they're all going there, that's where your artifact must be.'"

**Information Provided:**

- Undead activity suggests Omu's location
- Omu is referenced in old maps/legends
- The city is considered mythical by most
- Undead movement patterns reveal the direction

### 3. Clues in Ruins and Ancient Sites

**Location:** Nangalore, Heart of Ubtao, other ruins

**What to Say:**

> "As you examine the ancient carvings, you notice a recurring symbol - a stylized city surrounded by death. The inscriptions speak of 'Omu, the city of the gods, where life and death meet.' The carvings show the city being consumed by darkness, and references to a 'soul-devouring artifact' that was sealed away. The location matches the direction the undead have been traveling."

**Information Provided:**

- Ancient references to Omu
- Connection between Omu and death/undead
- References to a soul-devouring artifact
- Directional clues from carvings

### 4. Following Undead Activity

**Location:** Throughout jungle travel

**What to Say:**

> "You've noticed a pattern: every undead encounter, every zombie horde, every skeleton patrol - they're all moving in the same direction. Your guide confirms it: 'They're heading toward something. The undead don't wander aimlessly - they're drawn to a source of necromantic power. If we follow them, we'll find what's creating them. And based on the legends, that source is in Omu - the Forbidden City.'"

**Information Provided:**

- Undead movement patterns reveal direction
- Undead are drawn to a necromantic source
- Following undead leads to Omu
- Confirmation from guide's knowledge

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about Omu at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "You've gathered enough information to understand your destination. The Soulmonger - the artifact causing the Death Curse - is located in Omu, the Forbidden City. Omu is a lost city deep in the jungle interior, hidden and protected by ancient magic. It was once a great city of the Chultan gods, but it fell long ago and has been lost to the jungle.
>
> The undead you've encountered are all drawn toward Omu - they're being created or summoned by the Soulmonger's power. Following the undead activity will lead you to the city. The journey is extremely dangerous - the jungle becomes more hostile the closer you get to Omu, and the undead become more numerous and powerful.
>
> To reach Omu, you must travel deep into the jungle interior, following the signs: increased undead activity, areas where life itself seems to wither, and the direction the undead are moving. The city itself is hidden, but those who seek it can find it if they're persistent and brave enough.
>
> Once you reach Omu, you'll need to find the Soulmonger within the city and destroy it. But first, you must survive the journey there. Are you ready to make this final push into the heart of danger?"

**When to Use This:** When players have gathered information from multiple sources or completed a major information-gathering encounter (like meeting the oracle at Orolunga)
