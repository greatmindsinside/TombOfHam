*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

**Location:** Orolunga Ziggurat, Top Chamber

## Overview

Saja N'baza is a guardian naga who serves as the oracle of Orolunga. She can provide direct information about Omu and the Soulmonger, but she requires players to prove their worthiness or complete a task.

## Meeting the Oracle

### Climbing the Ziggurat

**What to Say:**

> "The stairs are ancient but solid, carved into the ziggurat's stone. As you climb, you feel a sense of anticipation - something powerful awaits at the top. The climb is long, but not difficult. With each step, you rise above the jungle canopy, and the view becomes breathtaking. Finally, you reach the top - a chamber open to the sky, with ancient carvings covering the walls.
>
> In the center of the chamber, a massive serpent-like creature coils. Her scales shimmer with an otherworldly light, and her eyes hold ancient wisdom. This is Saja N'baza, the oracle of Orolunga. She watches you with calm, intelligent eyes, waiting."

### First Meeting

**What to Say:**

> "The naga's voice is melodious but ancient, speaking in a language you understand despite never having heard it before. 'Welcome, seekers. I am Saja N'baza, guardian of Orolunga. You have come far to reach this place. I sense you seek answers - answers about the Death Curse, about the artifact that plagues your world. I can provide those answers, but knowledge comes with a price. You must prove yourselves worthy, or complete a task that demonstrates your commitment to this quest.'"

## Oracle's Task or Test

### Option 1: Test of Worthiness

**What to Say:**

> "The oracle's eyes seem to look into your very souls. 'I will ask you three questions. Answer truthfully, and with wisdom. First: Why do you seek to end the Death Curse? Is it for personal gain, for the greater good, or for something else? Second: What are you willing to sacrifice to achieve this goal? Third: When you face the Soulmonger, what will you do if destroying it requires a terrible price? Answer these, and I will know if you are worthy of the knowledge you seek.'"

**Player Responses:**

- Players must answer honestly
- Oracle judges their answers
- Wisdom and selflessness are valued
- Greed and selfishness are rejected

### Option 2: Task to Complete

**What to Say:**

> "The oracle considers your request. 'I will tell you what you seek, but first, you must help me. There is a threat to Orolunga - [describe threat]. If you can resolve this threat, I will provide the information you need. This is not a test of strength alone, but of wisdom, compassion, and commitment. Will you accept this task?'"

**Possible Tasks:**

- Defeat a threat to the ziggurat
- Help someone in need
- Retrieve an artifact
- Solve a puzzle or riddle
- Prove moral character

## Receiving Information

### If Players Prove Worthy

**What to Say:**

> "The oracle nods, satisfied. 'You have proven yourselves worthy. I will tell you what you seek. The Soulmonger - the artifact causing the Death Curse - is located in Omu, the Forbidden City. Omu lies deep in the jungle interior, hidden by ancient magic. It was once a great city, home to the gods of Chult, but it fell long ago. Now, the Soulmonger resides there, drawing the undead to it like a beacon.
>
> To reach Omu, you must follow the signs: where the undead gather most thickly, where life itself seems to wither, where the old gods' power still lingers. The journey is extremely dangerous - the closer you get to Omu, the more powerful the undead become, and the more hostile the jungle grows.
>
> Once you reach Omu, you will find the Soulmonger within. But beware - the city itself is a death trap, filled with ancient guardians, deadly traps, and the undead drawn by the artifact's power. Destroying the Soulmonger will end the Death Curse, but it will not be easy. Are you prepared for this?'"

### If Players Fail the Test

**What to Say:**

> "The oracle's expression becomes stern. 'You are not yet ready. Your motives are unclear, or your commitment is insufficient. I cannot provide this knowledge to those who are not prepared to use it wisely. Return when you have proven yourselves, or seek answers elsewhere. The knowledge you seek is dangerous, and I will not give it to those who are not worthy.'"

**Options:**

- Players can try again after reflection
- Players can seek information from other sources
- Oracle may offer a different task

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "The oracle's voice echoes with finality. 'You have proven yourselves. I will tell you everything you need to know.
>
> The Soulmonger is in Omu, the Forbidden City. Omu is a lost city deep in the jungle interior, hidden by ancient magic. It was once the greatest city in Chult, home to the gods themselves, but it fell long ago. Now, the Soulmonger resides there, creating the Death Curse and drawing undead to it.
>
> To reach Omu, follow the undead. They are all drawn to the Soulmonger, and they will lead you to the city. The closer you get, the more numerous and powerful the undead become. The jungle itself becomes more hostile, and the land seems to reject life itself.
>
> The city is protected by ancient magic and filled with dangers: guardians, traps, and the undead. But the Soulmonger is there, and destroying it will end the Death Curse. This is your destination. This is where your quest leads.
>
> Go with wisdom, and may the gods guide you.'"
