## Types of Clues

### Ancient Carvings and Inscriptions

**Location:** Various ruins

**What to Say:**

> "The ancient carvings cover the walls, weathered but still legible. As you examine them, patterns emerge. You see repeated references to 'Omu, the city of the gods,' and depictions of a great city consumed by darkness. One carving shows a massive artifact - the Soulmonger - being sealed away within the city. The inscriptions speak of a 'curse that devours souls' and warn that 'those who seek the Forbidden City will find only death.'"

**Information Provided:**

- Omu was the city of the gods
- The Soulmonger is sealed in Omu

### Artifacts and Relics

**What to Say:**

> "Among the ruins, you discover an ancient artifact - a map fragment, a journal, or a relic. As you examine it, you realize it contains valuable information. The map shows the location of Omu, or the journal describes the city's fall, or the relic resonates with necromantic energy that points toward the Soulmonger's location."

**Information Provided:**

- Directional clues to the Soulmonger
- Context about the Death Curse

### Environmental Clues

**Location:** Throughout jungle

**What to Say:**

Your guide confirms it: 'This is a sign. The Soulmonger's power affects everything around it. Where life dies and undead gather, that's where we'll find Omu.'"

**Information Provided:**

- Directional clues from environmental changes
