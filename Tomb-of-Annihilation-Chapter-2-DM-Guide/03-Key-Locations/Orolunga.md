**Location:** Orolunga, Ancient Ziggurat

## Overview

Orolunga is an ancient ziggurat housing a powerful oracle (Saja N'baza, a naga) that can reveal the Soulmonger's location. This is one of the most direct ways for players to learn about Omu.

## What to Say

> "Rising from the jungle canopy, an ancient ziggurat towers above the trees. The structure is massive, weathered by centuries, but still imposing. Stairs carved into the stone lead upward, and the entire structure radiates an aura of ancient power and wisdom.
>
> Your guide stops, clearly in awe. 'Orolunga. The Oracle Ziggurat. They say a wise oracle dwells within - one who knows the secrets of Chult. If you seek the Soulmonger, this is where you might find answers. But the oracle doesn't give information freely - you'll need to prove yourselves worthy, or complete a task.'"
