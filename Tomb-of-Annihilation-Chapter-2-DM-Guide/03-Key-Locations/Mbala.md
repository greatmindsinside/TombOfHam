**Location:** Mbala, Ruined Village on Plateau

## Overview

Mbala is a ruined village on a plateau, now home to Nanny Pu'pu, a green hag. The hag offers dangerous information about the Soulmonger but demands dark payment.

## What to Say

> "The plateau rises above the jungle, and on it, you see the ruins of what was once a village. The buildings are collapsed, overgrown, and the entire place feels wrong - like something dark has claimed it. The air itself seems tainted, and you sense powerful magic at work.
>
> Your guide stops, clearly uneasy. 'Mbala. Ruined village. A hag lives here now - Nanny Pu'pu. She knows things, powerful things. She might tell you about the Soulmonger, but hags don't give information for free. Her price will be... unpleasant. This is a dangerous place. Are you sure you want to go there?'"
