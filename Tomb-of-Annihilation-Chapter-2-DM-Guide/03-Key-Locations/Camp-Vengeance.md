## Overview

## What to Say

> "As you approach, you hear the sounds of battle - steel on bone, shouted orders, and the moans of the undead. Through the trees, you see a fortified camp under attack. Paladins and clerics in the colors of the Order of the Gauntlet fight desperately against waves of zombies and skeletons.
>
> Your guide pauses. 'Camp Vengeance. Order of the Gauntlet outpost. They've been under siege for weeks. The undead keep coming - drawn by something in the jungle interior, they say. They could use help, but helping means getting involved in a losing battle.'"
