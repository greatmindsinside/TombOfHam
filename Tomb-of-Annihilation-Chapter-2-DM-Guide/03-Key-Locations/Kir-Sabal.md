**Location:** Kir Sabal, Aarakocra Village in the Treetops

## Overview

Kir Sabal is a village built in the treetops, home to aarakocra (bird-like humanoids). The village offers unique perspectives, potential aerial transportation, and information about Chult.

## What to Say

> "High in the canopy, you see structures built among the massive trees - platforms, rope bridges, and nests woven into the branches. Bird-like humanoids move gracefully between the structures, their wings allowing them to navigate the treetops with ease.
>
> Your guide points upward. 'Kir Sabal. Aarakocra village. They live in the treetops, safe from most ground-based dangers. They know the jungle from above - a perspective we ground-walkers rarely get. They might have information, or even offer transportation to hard-to-reach locations.'"
