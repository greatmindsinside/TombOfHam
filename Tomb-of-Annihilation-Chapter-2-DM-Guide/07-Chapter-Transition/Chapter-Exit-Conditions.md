# Chapter 2 Exit Conditions

*Official source: Transition to Chapter 3: **pp. [page numbers]***  
*Reference: [D&D 5E - Tomb of Annihilation.pdf](../../D&D%205E%20-%20Tomb%20of%20Annihilation.pdf)*

**Location:** Jungle (Before Journey to Omu)

## What to Say

> "You've spent days, perhaps weeks, exploring the jungle. You've faced dinosaurs, undead, disease, and the elements. You've visited ancient ruins, met powerful NPCs, and gathered information from multiple sources. Now, the pieces are coming together. You know where you need to go: Omu, the Forbidden City, where the Soulmonger awaits.
>
> The journey ahead will be the most dangerous yet. The closer you get to Omu, the more powerful the undead become, and the more hostile the jungle grows. But you have a destination, you have information, and you're as ready as you'll ever be. The time has come to make the final push toward the lost city and end the Death Curse once and for all."

## What Players Should Have

- **Omu's Location**: Knowledge that the Soulmonger is in Omu and how to reach it → [Finding-Omu.md](../06-Information-Gathering/Finding-Omu.md)
- **Survival Experience**: Understanding of jungle dangers and survival mechanics → [Survival-Challenges.md](../05-Weather-and-Survival/Survival-Challenges.md)
- **Adequate Supplies**: Sufficient resources for the journey to Omu → [Resource-Management.md](../02-Travel-Mechanics/Resource-Management.md)
- **Guide (Optional)**: Guide may continue or players may proceed alone → [Navigation-and-Getting-Lost.md](../02-Travel-Mechanics/Navigation-and-Getting-Lost.md)
- **Understanding**: Knowledge of what awaits in Omu (danger, undead, the Soulmonger) → [Finding-Omu.md](../06-Information-Gathering/Finding-Omu.md)

## Immediate Options for Players

1. **Verify readiness** - Use skill checks to ensure all essential elements are in place
2. **Final preparations** - Resupply, rest, prepare for the journey
3. **Gather missing information** - If Omu's location is unknown, seek information sources
4. **Choose route** - Decide how to approach Omu
5. **Begin journey** - Start the final push toward Omu

## DM Guidance

Before allowing transition to Chapter 3, verify players know Omu's location. They should have gathered information from at least one source (oracle, NPCs, clues, or following undead). If missing essential information, provide opportunities to gather it. Once players know Omu's location and are ready, transition to the journey. This marks the end of Chapter 2 and the beginning of the approach to Omu.

## Complete Essential Information Delivery

If players need all essential information about exit requirements at once, use this comprehensive delivery:

**What to Say (Complete Essential Info):**

> "As you prepare for the final journey to Omu, let me make sure you understand what you absolutely must have before making this push:
>
> **First, Omu's location:** You need to know where Omu is and how to reach it. This information can come from the oracle at Orolunga, NPCs at various locations, clues in ruins, or following undead activity. Without knowing where you're going, you'd be wandering aimlessly. Omu is deep in the jungle interior, and you must follow the signs: increased undead activity, areas where life withers, and the direction the undead are moving.
>
> **Second, survival experience:** You should understand the dangers of jungle travel - disease, weather, exhaustion, encounters. You've faced these challenges already, and you know how to handle them. The journey to Omu will be more dangerous, but your experience will help.
>
> **Third, adequate supplies:** You need sufficient resources for the journey. Food, water, insect repellent, and other supplies. The journey to Omu is long and dangerous, and running out of supplies could mean death. Make sure you have enough, or know how to find more along the way.
>
> **Fourth, understanding of what awaits:** You should know that Omu is extremely dangerous - filled with undead, ancient guardians, traps, and the Soulmonger itself. The journey will be challenging, but reaching Omu is only the beginning. The city itself is a death trap.
>
> Once you have Omu's location and are prepared, you can begin the journey. Are you ready to make this final push?"

**When to Use This:** If players are ready to leave but lack essential information, or need clarification on requirements
