**Location:** Jungle (Final Approach to Omu)

## Overview

The journey to Omu is the most dangerous part of Chapter 2. As players approach the lost city, the undead become more numerous and powerful, the jungle becomes more hostile, and the land itself seems to reject life.

## What to Say (Beginning the Journey)

> "You've made your decision. Omu is your destination, and you know the direction. You set out, following the signs: the undead activity, the withering of life, the pull of necromantic power. The journey ahead will be the most dangerous yet, but you're committed.
>
> As you travel, you notice the changes: the undead become more frequent, more organized, more powerful. The jungle itself seems to reject life - plants wither, animals flee, and the air grows heavy with death. You're getting closer. Omu awaits."

## Journey Characteristics

### Increased Undead Activity

**What to Say:**

> "The undead are everywhere now. What were once scattered zombies and skeletons have become organized patrols, moving with purpose. They're all heading in the same direction - toward Omu. You must fight through them, avoid them, or find a way around. But they're relentless, and their numbers seem endless."

**Encounter Frequency:** 2-3 encounters per day (instead of 1-2)

**Undead Power:** More powerful undead (wights, wraiths, mummies)

### Hostile Environment

**What to Say:**

> "The land itself seems to reject life. Plants wither and die, the ground becomes barren, and the air is thick with the stench of decay. The jungle, once dangerous but alive, now feels dead. This is the Soulmonger's influence - it's killing everything around it."

**Environmental Effects:**

- Difficult terrain (withering plants, dead ground)
- Increased disease risk (decay and death)
- Exhaustion from the oppressive atmosphere
- Reduced food/water sources

### Navigation Challenges

**What to Say:**

> "Navigation becomes more difficult. The undead activity and environmental changes make it hard to follow your intended route. Your guide [if present] struggles with the navigation, and you must rely on following the undead or using other methods to find your way."

**Navigation DC:** Increases to 12-15 (from normal DC 10)

**Getting Lost:** More dangerous - lost travelers face more undead

## Daily Travel During Journey

### Morning Routine

1. **Weather Roll** - Determine daily weather
2. **Undead Activity Check** - Roll for undead encounters (higher chance)
3. **Navigation Check** - More difficult due to hostile environment
4. **Resource Check** - Track consumption (may be higher due to danger)

### During Travel

1. **Describe increasing danger** - Undead activity, hostile environment
2. **Random Encounters** - 2-3 per day, mostly undead
3. **Environmental Hazards** - Withering land, decay, death
4. **Resource Challenges** - Finding food/water becomes harder

### Evening Routine

1. **Find Safe Camp** - More difficult due to undead activity
2. **Set Enhanced Watch** - Undead may attack at night
3. **Rest** - May be interrupted by undead encounters
4. **Plan Next Day** - Adjust route based on undead activity

## Approaching Omu

### Final Approach

**What to Say:**

> "After days of dangerous travel, you see it in the distance: Omu, the Forbidden City. It rises from the jungle like a monument to death itself. The city is massive, ancient, and clearly abandoned - but not empty. You can see undead moving through the streets, and you sense powerful necromantic magic emanating from within.
>
> The journey has been brutal, but you've made it. Omu awaits. The Soulmonger is somewhere in that city, and your quest to destroy it and end the Death Curse is about to reach its climax. But first, you must enter the city - and that will be the most dangerous part yet."

### Reaching Omu

**What to Say:**

> "You stand at the edge of Omu, the Forbidden City. The city is everything you expected and more: massive, ancient, filled with undead, and radiating necromantic power. The Soulmonger is here, somewhere in this city. Your journey through the jungle is complete, but your quest is far from over. Now, you must enter Omu and find the Soulmonger within."
