**Location:** Edge of Omu, The Forbidden City

## Overview

Before entering Omu, players should understand what awaits them: a city filled with undead, ancient guardians, deadly traps, and the Soulmonger itself. This document helps prepare players for Chapter 3.

## What to Say (At the Edge of Omu)

> "You stand at the edge of Omu, the Forbidden City. The city sprawls before you - massive, ancient, and clearly abandoned. But it's not empty. You can see undead moving through the streets, and you sense powerful necromantic magic emanating from deep within the city.
>
> This is it. The Soulmonger is somewhere in that city, and your quest to destroy it and end the Death Curse is about to reach its climax. But entering Omu will be the most dangerous thing you've done yet. The city is a death trap: filled with undead, protected by ancient magic, and home to guardians that have stood watch for centuries.
>
> You've come this far. You've survived the jungle, gathered information, and reached your destination. Now, you must enter the city and find the Soulmonger. Are you ready?"

## What Awaits in Omu

### Undead Hordes

**What to Say:**

> "The undead are everywhere in Omu. Zombies, skeletons, wights, wraiths - they patrol the streets, guard the buildings, and are drawn to the Soulmonger's power. You'll need to fight through them, avoid them, or find another way. But they're relentless, and their numbers are vast."

### Ancient Guardians

**What to Say:**

> "Omu was once protected by powerful magic and ancient guardians. Many of those guardians still remain, standing watch over the city long after its fall. You may encounter constructs, magical traps, and other defenses that have protected the city for centuries."

### Deadly Traps

**What to Say:**

> "The city is filled with traps - both magical and mechanical. Ancient Chultans protected their city well, and those protections remain active. You'll need to be careful, observant, and prepared for danger around every corner."

### The Soulmonger

**What to Say:**

> "The Soulmonger is somewhere in Omu, deep within the city. Its necromantic power is what's creating the Death Curse and drawing all the undead. Finding it will be difficult, and destroying it will be even harder. But that's your goal - that's why you're here."

## Final Preparations

### Rest and Recovery

**What to Say:**

> "Before entering Omu, you should rest and recover. The journey here was brutal, and you'll need all your strength for what lies ahead. Find a safe place to camp, tend to your wounds, and prepare yourselves mentally and physically for the challenges ahead."

### Supply Check

**What to Say:**

> "Check your supplies. You'll need food, water, and other resources for exploring the city. Omu is dangerous, and you may not be able to find supplies within. Make sure you have what you need, or know how to get more."

### Information Review

**What to Say:**

> "Review everything you know about Omu. The information you've gathered, the clues you've found, the warnings you've received. All of it will be valuable once you're inside the city. Remember what you've learned, and use it to guide your exploration."

## Entering Omu

### Choosing an Entry Point

**What to Say:**

> "Omu has multiple entry points: main gates, side entrances, collapsed walls, and other ways in. Each has its own dangers and advantages. Which way do you want to enter? The main gates are obvious but likely guarded. Side entrances might be less defended but more dangerous. Collapsed walls offer easy access but may be unstable. Choose carefully."

### First Steps

**What to Say:**

> "You enter Omu, the Forbidden City. The moment you step inside, you feel the weight of the place - ancient, powerful, and deadly. The undead notice you immediately, and you can sense the Soulmonger's power pulling at you, trying to claim your soul.
>
> This is it. You're in Omu. The Soulmonger is here, somewhere. Your quest to end the Death Curse is about to reach its climax. But first, you must survive the city itself. Welcome to Omu. May the gods have mercy on your souls."
