**Location:** Jungle (When Navigation Fails)

## Overview

Getting lost in the jungle is a serious threat. Without proper navigation, players waste days, consume extra resources, and face increased danger. This document covers what happens when navigation fails and how to handle getting lost.

## Navigation Failure

### When Guide Fails Navigation Check

**DC 10 Survival Check Failed:**

- Guide realizes they're lost
- Waste 1 day finding way back
- Consume extra resources (food, water)
- Increased chance of random encounters

### Getting Seriously Lost

**Multiple Failed Checks or Critical Failure:**

- Waste 2-3 days
- Consume significant resources
- High chance of dangerous encounters
- Players may need to find landmarks or ask for help

## What to Say (Getting Lost)

> "Your guide stops, looking confused. They check their markers, examine the sun's position, and consult their map. After several minutes, they turn to you with a grim expression.
>
> 'I'm not sure where we are,' they admit. 'The trail markers are gone, or I've missed them. We might have taken a wrong turn, or the jungle has changed since I last came this way. We need to find our bearings - this could take a day, maybe more.'"

## Finding the Way Back

### Guide Attempts to Recover

**DC 12 Survival Check (Guide):**

- **Success**: Find way back to known route (waste 1 day)
- **Failure**: Still lost, waste another day
- **Critical Success (17+)**: Find way back quickly (waste half day)

### Players Can Help

**DC 13 Survival Check (Players):**

- **Success**: Help guide find the way (reduce lost time)
- **Failure**: No help, rely on guide
- **Critical Success (18+)**: Find the way independently (guide learns from you)

### Using Landmarks

**DC 11 Perception Check**: Spot recognizable landmarks

- **Success**: Identify location and correct course
- **Failure**: Landmarks are unfamiliar
- **Critical Success (16+)**: Identify location and find shortcut

## Consequences of Being Lost

### Time Wasted

- **1 day lost**: Minor delay, consume extra day's resources
- **2-3 days lost**: Significant delay, consume multiple days' resources
- **3+ days lost**: Serious problem, may need outside help

### Resource Consumption

- **Extra food and water** consumed while lost
- **Increased exhaustion** from wandering
- **Higher encounter chance** (lost travelers are vulnerable)

### Increased Danger

- **More random encounters** while lost
- **Higher chance of dangerous terrain** (swamps, cliffs, etc.)
- **Risk of encountering hostile creatures** or tribes

## What to Say (Finding the Way)

> "After [X hours/X days] of careful navigation, your guide's expression brightens. 'There!' they point. 'I recognize that [landmark]. We're back on track. We lost [time], but at least we know where we are now. Let's get moving - we need to make up for lost time.'"
