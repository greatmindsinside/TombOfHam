**Location:** Jungle (Daily Resource Tracking)

## Overview

Players must track food, water, and supplies during jungle travel. Running out of resources leads to exhaustion, disease, and potential death.

## Daily Resource Consumption

### Water

- **Normal Conditions**: 1 gallon per person per day
- **Extreme Heat**: 2 gallons per person per day
- **Strenuous Activity**: +0.5 gallons per person
- **Running Out**: Exhaustion, then death in 3 days without water

### Food

- **Normal Conditions**: 1 ration per person per day
- **Strenuous Activity**: +0.5 rations per person
- **Running Out**: Exhaustion after 3 days, then starvation

### Insect Repellent

- **Daily Use**: 1 application per person per day
- **Without Protection**: Daily DC 10 Constitution save vs. disease
- **Running Out**: Increased disease risk

### Other Supplies

- **Torches/Oil**: For light (if needed)
- **Rope/Tools**: For challenges and obstacles
- **Medical Supplies**: For treating disease and injuries

## Tracking Resources

### Daily Consumption

**Each day of travel:**

- Consume water (1-2 gallons per person)
- Consume food (1 ration per person)
- Use insect repellent (if available)
- Check for supply damage (storms, accidents)

### Finding Resources

**DC 12 Survival Check**: Find food or water

- **Success**: Find 1d4+1 days of food OR 2d4 gallons of water
- **Failure**: No resources found, waste time searching
- **Critical Success (17+)**: Find abundant resources (2d4+2 days food, 4d4 gallons water)

### Resource Shortages

**If players run low on resources:**

- **Water Shortage**: Exhaustion, then death
- **Food Shortage**: Exhaustion, then starvation
- **No Repellent**: Daily disease saves
- **Missing Supplies**: Cannot handle certain challenges

## What to Say (Resource Check)

> "As you make camp for the evening, you take stock of your supplies. [Water/Food/Supplies] are [plentiful/running low/critical]. You've consumed [amount] today, and you have [remaining] left. At this rate, you'll [last X days/run out in X days/run out tomorrow]. [If low: Your guide looks concerned. 'We need to find more [resource] soon, or we'll be in trouble.']"
