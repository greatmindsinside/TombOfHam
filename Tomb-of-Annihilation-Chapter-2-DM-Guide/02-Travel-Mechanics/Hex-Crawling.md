**Location:** Jungle (Various Hexes)

## Overview

Chapter 2 uses hex-crawl mechanics for wilderness travel. The jungle is divided into hexes, and players travel from hex to hex, facing navigation challenges, random encounters, and resource consumption.

## Travel Speed

### Normal Pace

- **1 hex per day** - Standard travel speed
- Allows for careful navigation and avoiding dangers
- Guide makes DC 10 Survival check for navigation

### Fast Pace

- **2 hexes per day** - Faster travel with risk
- Requires DC 15 Constitution save or gain exhaustion
- Higher chance of getting lost or encountering dangers

### Slow Pace

- **0.5 hexes per day** - Cautious travel
- Advantage on navigation checks
- Lower chance of random encounters
- Better chance to find resources

## Navigation

### Guide Navigation Check

**Daily DC 10 Survival Check (Guide):**

- **Success**: Travel 1 hex in intended direction
- **Failure**: Get lost - waste 1 day finding way, or travel in wrong direction
- **Critical Success (15+)**: Travel 1 hex + find shortcut or safe route

### Getting Lost

**If navigation fails:**

- Roll 1d6 to determine direction error
- 1-2: Travel in random direction (1d8 for direction)
- 3-4: Waste 1 day finding way back
- 5-6: Waste 2 days, consume extra resources

### Without a Guide

**DC 15 Survival Check (without guide):**

- **Success**: Travel 1 hex (50% chance of correct direction)
- **Failure**: Get lost, waste 1-2 days
- **Critical Failure**: Get seriously lost, waste 3+ days

**Note**: This is why guides are essential - navigation without one is extremely difficult.

## Terrain Types

### Normal Jungle

- **Travel Speed**: 1 hex per day (normal pace)
- **Navigation DC**: 10
- **Encounter Chance**: Normal

### Difficult Terrain (Mountains, Swamps)

- **Navigation DC**: 12
- **Encounter Chance**: Higher
- **Resource Consumption**: Increased

### River Travel (with Canoe)

- **Travel Speed**: 2-3 hexes per day
- **Navigation DC**: 8 (easier on rivers)
- **Encounter Chance**: Lower
- **Resource Consumption**: Normal

### Open Areas

- **Travel Speed**: 1.5 hexes per day
- **Navigation DC**: 8

2. **Random Encounter** - 1-2 encounters per day (DM choice)
3. **Resource Consumption** - Track food, water, supplies
4. **Navigation Challenges** - Handle getting lost if applicable

### Evening

1. **Find Camp Site** - Locate safe place to rest
2. **Set Watch** - Assign watch rotation
3. **Rest** - Long rest if safe
4. **Plan Next Day** - Decide destination and route

## What to Say (Daily Travel)

> "Another day in the jungle. The terrain [varies/remains consistent] - [describe current hex]. Your guide navigates [skillfully/carefully], [avoiding/facing] [dangers/challenges]. The heat is [constant/intense], the insects [relentless/active], and every step requires effort. You push forward, deeper into the unknown, [toward your destination/following your guide's lead]."
