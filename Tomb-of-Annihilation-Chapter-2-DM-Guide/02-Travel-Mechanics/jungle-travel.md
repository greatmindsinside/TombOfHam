# Jungle Travel Rules

**Back to:** [Chapter 2 Home](../README.md) | [Travel Mechanics](../02-Travel-Mechanics/)

---

## Overview

Traveling through the Chultan jungle is dangerous and requires careful resource management.

---

## Basic Travel

### Movement

- **Normal pace**: 1 hex per day
- **Fast pace**: 2 hexes per day (risk of exhaustion)
- **Slow pace**: 0.5 hexes per day (more careful, less risk)

### Navigation

- **Guide makes DC 10 Survival check** daily
- **Failure**: Party is lost (waste 1 day finding way)
- **Without guide**: DC 15 Survival (much harder)

---

## Daily Checks

### Weather (Roll 1d6)

1-2: **Clear and Hot** - Normal travel, risk of heat exhaustion
3-4: **Humid and Overcast** - Uncomfortable but manageable
5: **Tropical Storm** - Difficult travel, risk to supplies, need shelter
6: **Extreme Heat** - Exhaustion risk, extra water needed

### Disease

**Daily DC 10 Constitution save** when exposed to:

- Mosquitoes (malaria risk)
- Contaminated water (dysentery risk)
- Infected wounds (infection risk)

**Disease Effects:**

- **Level 1**: Disadvantage on ability checks
- **Level 2**: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
- **Level 3+**: Hit point maximum reduced, risk of death

**Cure**: Medicine check (DC 15) or magic (lesser restoration)

---

## Resource Management

### Water

- **1 gallon per person per day** (critical in heat)
- **Storms**: Can collect rainwater
- **Rivers**: Can refill if accessible
- **Running out**: Constitution saves vs. exhaustion

### Food

- **1 ration per person per day**
- **Hunting**: Survival DC 12 to find food
- **Running out**: Exhaustion levels

### Supplies

- **Insect repellent**: Prevents disease (daily use)
- **Tents**: Protection from weather and insects
- **Canoes**: Faster river travel (2-3 hexes per day)

## Random Encounters

Roll 1d12 for daily encounters (or choose based on story needs):

1. Dinosaur Herd (herbivores) - Avoidable, or potential food source
2. Predator Attack (carnivorous dinosaur) - Combat encounter
3. Undead (zombies/skeletons) - Combat, suggests Soulmonger's influence
4. Weather Event (storm, heat wave) - Survival challenge
5. Disease Vector (mosquitoes, contaminated water) - Disease check
6. Discovery (ruins, trail, camp) - Exploration opportunity
7. Tribal Encounter (Batiri goblins, Chultan natives) - Social/combat
8. Natural Hazard (quicksand, falling tree, flash flood) - Skill challenge
9. Other Adventurers (friendly or hostile) - Social encounter
10. Magical Anomaly (strange magic, portal, artifact) - Mystery/opportunity
11. Animal Attack (giant snakes, spiders, etc.) - Combat
12. No Encounter - Peaceful travel day

---

## Exhaustion

**Causes:**

- Heat exposure
- Forced march (fast pace)
- Disease
- Lack of water/food

**Levels:**

1. Disadvantage on ability checks
2. Speed halved
3. Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4. Hit point maximum halved
5. Speed reduced to 0
6. Death

**Recovery**: Long rest in safe location (camp, ruins, friendly settlement)

---

## Getting Lost

**If navigation fails:**

- Roll 1d6: 1-3 = waste 1 day, 4-6 = waste 2 days
- Guide can attempt DC 15 Survival to find way back
- Without guide: Much harder to recover

---

## Rivers & Waterways

**Canoe travel:**

- **2-3 hexes per day** (much faster)
- **Requires canoe** (50 gp in Port Nyanzaru)
- **River hazards**: Rapids, waterfalls, dangerous creatures
- **Navigation**: Easier (DC 8 Survival)

---

## Difficult Terrain

**Mountains/Swamps:**

- **0.5 hexes per day** (slower travel)
- **More dangerous** - Higher encounter chance
- **More exhausting** - Higher exhaustion risk

---

## Resting

**Long Rest Requirements:**

- **Safe location** - Camp, ruins, friendly settlement
- **8 hours** - Cannot be interrupted
- **Recovers**: HP, spell slots, removes exhaustion (1 level)

**Short Rest:**

- **1 hour** - Can be done anywhere
- **Recovers**: Some abilities, no HP without special features

---

## DM Tips

- **Track resources** - Make water and food matter
- **Use weather** - Vary conditions to create challenges
- **Balance encounters** - Not every day needs combat
- **Show progress** - Let players know they're getting closer to destinations
- **Use guide** - Guide can provide information and reduce some dangers
