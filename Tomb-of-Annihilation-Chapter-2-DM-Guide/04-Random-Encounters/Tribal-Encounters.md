## Overview

Chult is home to various tribal groups: Batiri goblins, Chultan natives, grungs, and others. Encounters can be combat, social, or negotiation depending on how players approach them.

## Encounter Types

### Batiri Goblin Encounter

**What to Say (Batiri Goblin Ambush):**

> "You hear chattering and the sound of many small feet. Through the trees, you see a group of goblins - Batiri, your guide identifies them. They're setting up an ambush, clearly planning to attack. But they haven't noticed you yet - you have a moment to decide: fight, negotiate, or avoid."

**If Players Are Detected:**

> "One of the goblins looks up, its beady eyes locking onto you. It shrieks a warning, and suddenly a dozen goblins emerge from the undergrowth, brandishing spears and crude weapons. They're chattering excitedly, clearly excited about the prospect of a fight - or easy prey. Your guide mutters: 'Batiri. They're aggressive, but they're also cowards. If we show strength, they might back down. Or we could just kill them all.'"

**If Players Try to Negotiate:**

> "You hold up your hands, trying to show you mean no harm. The goblins pause, chattering among themselves. One steps forward - clearly a leader - and speaks in broken Common: 'You give us shiny things, we let you pass. Or we take shiny things from your dead bodies. Your choice.'"

**If Combat Begins:**

> "The goblins shriek with glee and charge. They're fast, aggressive, and they fight dirty - aiming for weak points, using hit-and-run tactics. Your guide shouts: 'Watch for traps! They like to set snares and pitfalls! And don't let them surround you - they'll overwhelm you with numbers!'"

They offer to trade information for supplies or help with a task.'"

**If Players Are Hostile:**

> "You raise your weapons, and the natives immediately respond in kind. Spears are leveled, and the tension is thick. Your guide's voice is urgent: 'Don't! These people know the jungle better than anyone. If we fight them, we'll have enemies everywhere. And they'll make sure we don't survive.'"

**If Players Offer Trade:**

> "The natives' eyes light up at the mention of trade. They're interested in metal tools, weapons, medicine, and food. Your guide negotiates: 'They want [specific items]. In exchange, they'll give us safe passage, information about the area, and maybe even guide us part of the way.'"
