**Location:** Jungle (Various Hexes)

## Overview

Undead encounters suggest the Soulmonger's influence. Zombies, skeletons, and other undead are drawn toward the artifact, creating a trail that can lead players to Omu.

## Encounter Types

### Zombie Horde

**What to Say (Zombie Horde Sighting):**

> "The stench hits you first - decay and death. Then you see them: a shambling horde of zombies, their flesh rotting, their movements jerky and unnatural. They haven't noticed you yet, but they're moving with purpose - all in the same direction, deeper into the jungle.
>
> Your guide's expression is grim. 'Undead. They're everywhere now, all moving toward something. The Soulmonger draws them. Where they're going, that's where you need to be - but getting there means getting past them.'"

**If Players Are Detected:**

> "One of the zombies turns its head, its milky eyes fixing on you. A low moan escapes its rotted lips, and the entire horde turns as one. Dozens of undead eyes lock onto you, and they begin shambling forward. Your guide draws their weapon: 'They've seen us. Fight or run - but don't let them surround you!'"

**If Players Follow Undead:**

> "You track the undead horde from a distance, moving carefully to avoid detection. As you follow, you notice they're all moving in the same direction - deeper into the jungle, toward the interior. Your guide nods: 'They're heading toward the Soulmonger. This is good - they're showing us the way. But we need to be careful. Where there are this many undead, there's something powerful controlling them.'"

>
> Your guide's voice trembles: 'A wight. This is bad. They're powerful, and they can drain your life force. And if it kills you, you'll rise as its servant. We need to be very careful, or we need to run.'"
