## Overview

Dinosaurs are common in Chult's jungle. Encounters range from peaceful herbivores to deadly predators. Use these encounters to establish the exotic nature of Chult and create memorable combat or avoidance challenges.

## Encounter Types

### Herbivore Encounters

**Common Herbivores:** Triceratops, stegosaurus, brontosaurus, hadrosaurus

**What to Say (Herbivore Sighting):**

> "A herd of [dinosaur type] grazes peacefully ahead. The massive creatures pay you no mind, focused on feeding. Your guide signals for caution. 'Herbivores. Usually not aggressive unless threatened. But they're big, and if we startle them, they could stampede. Let's go around quietly.'"

**If Players Approach Too Closely:**

> "The nearest [dinosaur type] raises its head, nostrils flaring. It lets out a low, rumbling warning - a sound that seems to vibrate through your chest. The other members of the herd look up, their attention now on you. Your guide's voice is urgent: 'Back away. Slowly. They're getting nervous. If they stampede, we're dead.'"

**If Players Startle the Herd:**

> "The herd explodes into motion. Massive bodies crash through the undergrowth, the ground shaking beneath their feet. Trees snap like twigs as the stampede thunders past. Your guide shouts over the chaos: 'Get to cover! Behind that fallen tree! Now!'"
