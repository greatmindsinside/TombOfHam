**Location:** Jungle (Various Hexes)

## Overview

The jungle itself is dangerous. Natural hazards like quicksand, falling trees, flash floods, and poisonous plants can threaten players even without creatures.

## Hazard Types

### Quicksand

**What to Say (Quicksand Discovery):**

> "The ground gives way beneath [character's] feet. What looked like solid earth is actually quicksand, and they're sinking fast. The more they struggle, the faster they sink. You need to act quickly."

**If Character Struggles:**

> "[Character] thrashes in the quicksand, but their movements only make things worse. They're sinking faster now - up to their waist, then their chest. The quicksand is thick, heavy, and it's pulling them down. Your guide shouts: 'Stop struggling! Lie flat! Spread your weight! Someone needs to help them now!'"

**If Rescue Attempt Succeeds:**

> "You manage to pull [character] free, but they're covered in thick, heavy mud. They're exhausted, and you've lost valuable time. Your guide looks around: 'There might be more quicksand nearby. We need to be more careful.'"

**If Rescue Fails:**

> "The quicksand continues to pull [character] down. They're up to their neck now, and panic is setting in. If they go under completely, they'll suffocate. You need to act immediately."

### Quicksand Environmental Mechanics

**Sinking Rate:**

- **Struggling:** Sinks 1 foot per round
- **Still:** Sinks 1 foot per 2 rounds

- **DC 10 Nature:** Know that struggling makes quicksand worse

**Rescue Mechanics:**

- **DC 12 Strength (Athletics):** Pull character out (requires rope or similar)
- **DC 10 Strength (Athletics):** Character can attempt to pull themselves out (if they stop struggling)
- **Rope/Equipment:** Reduces DC by 2
- **Multiple Helpers:** Each additional helper reduces DC by 1 (minimum DC 8)

**Damage:**

- **No Direct Damage:** Quicksand doesn't cause damage
- **Exhaustion:** Failed rescue attempts cause 1 level of exhaustion
- **Suffocation:** If fully submerged, character begins suffocating

### Flash Flood

**What to Say (Flash Flood Warning):**

> "A distant roar grows louder. Your guide's eyes widen. 'Flash flood! The storm upstream - the water's coming! Get to high ground, now!'"

**If Players React Quickly:**

> "You scramble up the nearest slope, grabbing onto trees and rocks. The water crashes through the area you just left, a wall of mud and debris. Trees snap like twigs, and the ground where you were standing is now a raging torrent. Your guide, panting, says: 'That was close. Flash floods come fast - you have to react immediately.'"

**If Players Are Too Slow:**

> "The water hits you before you can reach high ground. A wall of mud and debris crashes into you, knocking you off your feet. You're being swept away, tumbling in the churning water. Your guide shouts: 'Grab onto something! Anything! Don't let the current take you!'"

**If Players Are Caught in Flood:**

> "You're being swept downstream, the current pulling you under. Debris crashes into you - branches, rocks, mud. You can't breathe, can't see, can't tell which way is up. You need to fight your way to the surface, and you need to do it now."

**If Players React Quickly:**

> "You dive out of the way as the massive tree crashes down. The ground shakes with the impact, and you're showered with splinters and debris. The tree lands exactly where you were standing moments before. Your guide, breathing heavily, says: 'That was close. Dead trees are dangerous - they can fall without warning.'"

**If Players Are Too Slow:**

> "The tree crashes down on you before you can react. Massive branches slam into you, and you're pinned beneath the trunk. The impact is crushing, and you can't move. Your guide shouts: 'Are you okay? Can you move? We need to get you out from under there!'"

**If Players Are Pinned:**

> "You're trapped beneath the fallen tree. The weight is crushing, and you can't breathe properly. Every movement sends pain shooting through your body. You need help to get free, and you need it quickly - the pressure is building, and you're starting to lose feeling in your limbs."

**If Players Ingest Poisonous Plant:**

> "You sample a strange fruit or berry, thinking it might be safe to eat. But within minutes, your stomach cramps, and you feel nauseous. Your vision blurs, and you're starting to feel weak.
