**Location:** Jungle (Finding Resources)

## Overview

Players may need to find food, water, and shelter in the jungle. These survival challenges test players' preparation and resourcefulness.

## Finding Water

### Safe Water Sources

**What to Say:**

> "Your guide points to a stream. 'This looks safe - fast-moving, clear, coming from higher ground. But we should still be careful. Even clear water can be contaminated. Let me check.' Your guide examines the water, then nods. 'This is good. We can drink this, or collect it for later.'"

**DC 12 Survival Check:**

- **Success**: Find safe water source
- **Failure**: Find questionable water (risk of disease)
- **Critical Success (17+)**: Find abundant safe water

### Unsafe Water Sources

**What to Say:**

> "You find a stagnant pool. The water is murky, and you can see things moving in it. Your guide shakes their head. 'Not this. This water is contaminated - you'll get sick if you drink it. We need to find something better, or purify what we have.'"

**Risks:**

- Disease from contaminated water
- DC 10 Constitution save vs. disease
- Need purification or better source

### Purifying Water

**Methods:**

- Boiling (requires fire, time)
- Purify Food and Drink spell
- Water purification tablets (if available)
- Survival check to find natural purification methods

## Finding Food

### Hunting

**What to Say:**

> "You spot tracks - a small animal, possibly edible. Your guide examines them. 'We could try to hunt this. It would provide food, but hunting takes time and might attract predators. What do you want to do?'"

**DC 13 Survival Check:**

- **Success**: Successfully hunt and find food
- **Failure**: No food found, waste time
- **Critical Success (17+)**: Abundant food found

**Risks:**

- Time consumed (may affect travel)
- May attract predators
- May alert hostile creatures

### Foraging

**What to Say:**

> "Your guide points to some plants. 'These are edible - I recognize them. We can gather enough for a meal, maybe more. But we need to be careful - some plants look similar but are poisonous.'"

**DC 12 Survival/Nature Check:**

- **Success**: Find edible plants
- **Failure**: Find questionable plants (risk of poisoning)
- **Critical Success (16+)**: Find abundant safe food

**Risks:**

- Poisonous plants (if misidentified)
- Limited nutrition
- Time consumed

## Finding Shelter

### Safe Camp Sites

**What to Say:**

> "Your guide finds a good spot: elevated ground, natural cover, away from obvious dangers. 'This will work. We can set up camp here, and it should be relatively safe. We'll still need to set watch, but this is as good as we're going to find.'"

**DC 11 Survival Check:**

- **Success**: Find safe camp site
- **Failure**: Find questionable site (may be dangerous)
- **Critical Success (16+)**: Find excellent camp site (very safe, good resources nearby)

### Dangerous Camp Sites

**What to Say:**

> "The area looks questionable. Your guide is hesitant. 'I don't like this. The ground is soft - could be quicksand or unstable. And I see signs of predators nearby. We should find somewhere else, or be very careful if we stay here.'"

**Risks:**

- Unstable ground
- Predator activity
- Exposure to weather
- Increased encounter chance

## What to Say (Survival Challenge)
