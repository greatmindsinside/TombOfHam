**Location:** Jungle (Daily Weather)

## Overview

Chult's weather is extreme and dangerous. Daily weather rolls determine conditions that affect travel, resource consumption, and survival.

## Daily Weather Roll

**Roll 1d6 each day:**

1-2: **Clear and Hot** - Normal travel, risk of heat exhaustion
3-4: **Humid and Overcast** - Uncomfortable but manageable
5: **Tropical Storm** - Difficult travel, risk to supplies, need shelter
6: **Extreme Heat** - Exhaustion risk, extra water needed

## Weather Effects

### Clear and Hot

- **Travel**: Normal speed
- **Water Consumption**: Normal (1 gallon per person)
- **Risk**: DC 10 Constitution save vs. heat exhaustion
- **Description**: "The sun beats down mercilessly. The heat is intense, and you're sweating constantly."

### Humid and Overcast

- **Travel**: Normal speed
- **Water Consumption**: Normal
- **Risk**: Low
- **Description**: "The air is thick with humidity, but the cloud cover provides some relief from direct sunlight."

### Tropical Storm

- **Travel**: Half speed (0.5 hexes per day)
- **Water Consumption**: Normal (but can collect rainwater)
- **Risk**: Supplies damaged, need shelter, exhaustion from exposure
- **Description**: "Torrential rain, howling wind, and near-zero visibility. Travel becomes dangerous."

### Extreme Heat

- **Travel**: Normal speed, but exhaustion risk
- **Water Consumption**: Double (2 gallons per person)
- **Risk**: DC 12 Constitution save vs. exhaustion
- **Description**: "The heat is unbearable. You're drinking water constantly, and even standing still is exhausting."
